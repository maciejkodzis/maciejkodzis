Preface  
 
This book is designed to introduce doctoral and graduate students to the process of  
scientific research in the social science s, business, education, public health , and related 
disciplines.  This book is based on my lecture materials developed over a decade of teaching the 
doctoral -level class on Research Methods at the University of Sout h Florida.  The target 
audience for this book includes Ph.D. and graduate students, junior researchers, and professors 
teaching courses on research methods, although senior researchers can also use this book as a 
handy and compact reference.  
The first and most important question potential reader s should have about this book is 
how is it different from other text book s on the market?  Well, there are four key differences.  
First, unlike other text books, this book is not just about “research methods” (empiri cal data 
collection and analysis) but about the entire “research process” from start to end.  Research 
method is only one phase  in that research process, and  possibly the easiest and most structured  
one.   Most text books cover research methods in depth , but leave out the more challenging , less 
structured, and probably more important  issues such as theorizing and thinking like a 
researcher, which are often prerequisites of empirical research.  In my experience, most 
doctoral students become fairly competent at research methods during their  Ph.D. years , but 
struggle to generate interesting or useful research questions or build scientific theories.  To 
address this deficit, I have devoted entire chapters to topics such as “Th inking Like a 
Researcher” and “T heor ies in Scientific R esearch”, which are essential skills for a junior 
researcher.  
Second, the book is succinct and compact by design.  While writing the book, I decided 
to focus only on essential concepts , and not fill pages with clutter that can divert the  students’ 
attention to less relevant or tangential issues.  Most doctoral  seminar s include a fair 
complement of readings  drawn from the respective discipline.  This book is designed to 
complement those readings by summarizing all important concepts in one  compact volume, 
rather than burden students with a voluminous text on top of their assigned readings.  
Third, this book is free in its download version.  Not just the current edition but all 
future editions in perpetuity.  T he book will also be available in Kindle  e-Book, Apple iBook, and 
on-demand pape rback versions at a nominal  cost .  Many people have asked why I’m giving 
away something for free when I can make money selling it?  Well, not just to stop my students 
from constantly complaining about the hi gh price of text books, but also because I believe that 
scientific knowledge should not be constrained by access barriers such as price  and availability .  
Scientific progress can occur only if students and academics around  the world have affordable 
access to the best that science can offer, and this free book is my humble effort to that cause.  
However, free should not imply “lower qu ality.”  Some of the best things in life  such as air, 
water, and sunlight are free .  Many of Google ’s resources are free too , and one can well imagine 
where we would be in today’s Internet age without Google.  S ome of the most sophisticated 
software programs  available today, like Linux and Apache , are also free , and so is this book.  
Fourth, I plan to make local -language version s of this book available in due course of 
time , and those translated versions will also  be free .  So far, I have had commitments to 
 
ii 
 translate thus book into Chinese, French, Indonesian, Korean, Portuguese , Spanish  versions 
(which will hopefully be availabl e in 2012), and I’m looking for qualified researchers or 
professors to translate it into Arabic, German, and other languages where there is sufficient 
demand for a research text .  If you are a prospective translator, please note that there will be no 
finan cial gains or royalty for your translation  services, because the book must remain free , but 
I’ll gladly include you as a coauthor o n the local -language version.  
The book is structured into 16 chapters for a 16 -week semester.  However, professors 
or instruc tors can add, drop , stretch, or condense  topics to customize the book to the  specific 
needs of their curriculum.  For instance, I don’t cover Chapters 14 and 15 in my own class, 
because we have dedicated class es on statistics to cover those materials  and m ore.  Instead, I 
spend two weeks on theories (Chapter 3), one week to discussing  and conducting reviews for 
academic journals  (not in the book), and one week for a finals exam .  Nevertheless, I fe lt it 
necessary to include C hapters 14 and 15 for academic program s that may not have a dedicated 
class on statistical analysis for research.  A sample syllabus that I use for my own class in the 
business Ph.D. program is provided in the appendix.   
Lastly, I plan to continually update this book based on emerging trends in scientific 
research.  If there are any new or interesting content that you wish to see in future editions , 
please drop me a note, and I will try my best to accommodate them.   Comments, criticisms, or 
corrections to any of the existing co ntent will also be gratefully appreciated.

Science and Scientific Research  
 
 
 What is research?  Depending on who you ask, you will likely get very different answers 
to this seemingly innocuous question.  Some people will say that they routinely research 
different online websites to find the best place to buy goods or services they want .  Television 
news channels supposedly conduct research in the form of viewer polls on topics of public 
interest such as forthcoming elections or government -funded projects.  Undergraduate students 
research the Internet to find the information they nee d to complete assigned projects or term 
papers.  Graduate students working on research projects for a professor may see research as 
collecting or analyzing data related to their project.  Businesses and consultants research 
different potential solutions to  remedy organizational problems such as a supply chain 
bottleneck or to identify customer purchase patterns.  However, none of the above can be 
considered “scientific research” unless: (1) it contribute s to a body of science, and (2) it follow s 
the scienti fic method.  This chapter will examine what these terms mean.   
Science  
 What is science?  To some, science refers to difficult high school or college -level courses 
such as physi cs, chemistry, and biology meant only for the brightest students.  To others,  
science is a craft practiced by scientists in white coats using specialized equipment in their 
laboratories.  Etymologically, t he word “s cience”  is derived from the Latin word scientia  
meaning knowledge.  Science  refers to a systematic and organized body of knowledge in any 
area of inquiry that is acquired using “the scientific method” (the scientific method is described 
further below).  Science can be grouped into two broad categories: natural science and social 
science.  Natural science  is the science of naturally occurring objects or phenomena, such as 
light, objects, matter, earth, celestial bodies, or the human body.  Natural sciences can be further 
classified into physical sciences, earth sciences, life scien ces, and others.  Physical sciences 
consist of disciplines such as physics (the science of physical objects), chemistry (the science of 
matter), and astronomy (the science of celestial objects).  Earth sciences consist of disciplines 
such as geology (the s cience of the earth).  Life sciences include disciplines such as biology (the 
science of human bodies) and botany (the science of plants).  In contrast, social science  is the 
science of people or  collections of people, such as  groups, firms, societies, or economies , and 
their individual or collective behaviors.  Social sciences can be classified into disciplines such as 
psychology (the science of human behaviors), sociology (the science of social groups), and 
economics (the science of firms, markets, and ec onomies).  
 The natural sciences are different from the social sciences in several respects.  The 
natural sciences are very precise, accurate, deterministic, and independent of the person 
2 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 making the scientific observations.  For instance, a scientific exper iment in physics, such as 
measuring the speed of sound through a certain media or the refractive index of water, should 
always yield the exact same results, irrespective of the time or place of the experiment, or the 
person conducting the experiment.  If t wo students conducting the same physics experiment 
obtain two different values of these physical properties, then it generally means that one or 
both of those students must be in error.  However, the same cannot be said for the social 
sciences, which tend to be  less accurate, deterministic, or unambiguous.  For instance, if you 
measure a person’s happiness using a hypothetical  instrument, you may find that the same 
person is more happy or less happy (or sad) on different days and sometimes, at different tim es 
on the same day.  One’s happiness may vary depending on the news that person received that 
day or on the events that transpired earlier during that day.  Furthermore, there is not a single 
instrument or metric that can accurately measure a person’s happ iness.  Hence, one instrument 
may calibrate a person as being “more happy” while a second instrument may find that the 
same person is “less happy” at the same instant in time.  In other words, there is a high degree 
of measurement error  in the social scien ces and there is considerable uncertainty and little 
agreement on social science policy decisions.  For instance, you will not find many 
disagreements among natural scientists on the speed of light or the speed of the earth around 
the sun, but you will fin d numerous disagreements among social scientists on how to solve a 
social problem such as reduce global terrorism or rescue an economy from a recession.  Any 
student studying the social sciences must be cognizant of and comfortable with handling higher 
levels of ambiguity, uncertainty, and error that come with such sciences, which merely reflects 
the high variability of social objects.  
Sciences can also be classified based on their purpose.  Basic sciences , also called pure 
sciences, are those that explain the most basic  objects and  forces, relationships between them, 
and laws governing them.  Examples include physics, mathematics, and biology.  Applied 
sciences , also called practical sciences, are sciences that apply scientific knowledge from basic 
sciences  in a physical environment.   For instance, engineering is an applied science that applies 
the laws of physics and chemistry for practical applications such as building stronger bridges or 
fuel efficient combustion engines, while medicine is an applied scie nce that applies the laws of 
biology for solving human ailments.  Both basic and applied sciences are required for human 
development.  However, applied sciences cannot stand on their own right, but instead relies on 
basic sciences for its progress.  Of cou rse, the industry and private enterprises tend to focus 
more on applied sciences given their practical value, while universities study both basic and 
applied sciences.  
Scientific Knowledge  
The purpose of science is to create scientific knowledge.  Scientific knowledge  refers to 
a generalized body of  laws and theories to explain a phenomenon or behavior of interest that 
are acquired using the scientific method.  Laws  are observed patterns of phenomena or 
behaviors, while theories  are systematic expla nations of the underlying phenomenon or 
behavior.  For instance, in physics, the Newtonian Laws of Motion describe what happen s when 
an object is in a state of rest or motion (Newton’s First Law), what force is needed to move a 
stationary object or stop a moving object (Newton’s Second Law), and what happen s when two 
objects collide (Newton’s Third Law).  Collectively, the three laws constitute the basis of 
classical mechanics – a theory of moving objects.  Likewise, the theory of optics explains the 
proper ties of light and how it behaves in different media, electromagnetic theory explains the 
properties of electricity and how to generate it, quantum mechanics explains the properties of 
subatomic particles, and thermodynamics explains the properties of energ y and mechanical

 work.  A n introductory college level text book  in physics will likely contain separate chapters 
devoted to each of these theories.  Similar theories are also available in social sciences.  For 
instance, cognitive dissonance theory in psychology explains how people react when their 
observations of an e vent is different from what they expected of  that event, general deterrence 
theory explains why some people engage in improper or criminal behaviors, such as illegal ly 
download music or commit  software piracy, and the theory of planned behavior explains ho w 
people make conscious reasoned choices in their everyday lives.  
The goal of scientific research is to discover laws and postulate theories that can explain 
natural or social phenomena, or in other words, build scientific knowledge.  It is important to 
understand that this knowledge may be imperfect or even  quite far from the truth.  Sometimes, 
there may not be a singl e universal truth, but rather an  equilibrium  of “multiple truths.”  We 
must understand that the theories, upon which scientific knowledge is  based, are only 
explanations of a particular phenomenon, as suggested by a scientist.  As such, there may be 
good or poor explanations, depending on the extent to which those  explanations fit well with 
reality, and consequently, there may be good or poor theories.  The progress of science is 
marked by our progression over time from poorer theories to better theories, through better 
observations using more accurat e instruments  and more informed logical reasoning.   
We arrive at scientific laws or theories t hrough a process of logic and evidence.  Logic 
(theory) and evidence (observations) are the two , and only two,  pillars upon which scientific 
knowledge is based.  In science, theories and observations are interrelated and cannot exist 
without each other.  T heories provide meaning and significance to what we observe, and 
observations help validate or refine existing theory or construct  new theory.  Any other means 
of knowledge acquisition, such as faith  or authority cannot be considered science.  
Scientific Re search  
Given that theories and observations are the two pillars of science, scientific research 
operates at two levels: a theoretical level and an empirical level.  The theoretical level is 
concerned with developing abstract concepts about a natural or soc ial phenomenon and 
relationships between those concepts ( i.e., build  “theories ”), while the empirical level is 
concerned with testing the theoretical concepts and relationships to see how well they reflect  
our observations of reality, with the goal of ulti mately build ing better theories.  Over time, a 
theory becomes more and more refined (i.e., fits the observed reality better), and the science 
gains maturity.  Scientific res earch involves continually moving  back and forth between theory 
and observations.  Both t heory and observations are essential components of scientific 
research.  For instance,  relying solely on observations for making inferences and ignoring 
theory is not considered valid scientific research.  
Depending on a researcher’s training and interest, scientific inquiry may take one of two 
possible forms: inductive or deductive.  In inductive research , the goal of a researcher is to 
infer theoretical concepts and patterns from observed data.  In deducti ve research , the goal of 
the researcher  is to test concepts and patterns known from theory using new empirical data.  
Hence, inductive research is also called theory -building  research, and deductive research is 
theory -testing  research.  Note here that the goal of theory -testing is not just to test a theory, but 
possibly to refine, improve, and extend it.  Figure 1.1 depicts the complementary nature of 
inductive and deductive research.  Note that inductive and deductive research are two halves of 
the researc h cycle that constantly iterates between theory and observations.  You cannot do 
inductive or deductive research if you are not familiar with both the theory and data 
4 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 components of research.  Naturally, a complete researcher is one who can traverse the ent ire 
research cycle and can handle both inductive and deductive research.  
It is important to understand that theory -building (inductive research) and theory -
testing (deductive research) are both critical for the advancement of science.  Elegant theories 
are not valuable if they do not match with reality.  Likewise, mountains of data are also useless 
until  they can contribute to the construction to meaningful theories.  Rather than viewing these 
two processes in a circular relationship, as shown in Figure 1.1 , perhaps they can be better 
viewed as a helix, with each iteration between theory and data contributing to better 
explanations of the phenomenon of interest and better theories.  Though both inductive and 
deductive research are important for the advanceme nt of science, it appears that inductive 
(theory -building) research is more valuable when there are few prior theories or explanations, 
while deductive (theory -testing) research is more productive when there are many competing 
theories of the same phenomen on and researchers are interested in knowing which theory 
works best and under what circumstances.  
 
Figure 1.1.  The Cycle of Research  
 
Theory building and theory testing are particularly difficult in the social sciences, given 
the imprecise nature of the theoretical concepts, inadequate tools to measure them, and the 
presence of many unaccounted factors that can also influence the phenomenon of interest.  It is 
also very difficult to refute theories that do not work.  For instance, Karl Marx’s theory of 
communism as an effective means of economic production withstood for decades, before it was 
finally discredited as being inferior to capitalism in promoting economic growth and social 
welfare.  Erstwhile communist economies like the Soviet Union and China ev entually moved 
toward more capitalistic economies characterized by profit -maximizing private enterprises.  
However, the recent collapse of the mortgage and financial industries in the United States 
demonstrates that capitalism also has its flaws and is not  as effective in fostering economic 
growth and social welfare as previously presumed.  Unlike theories in the natural sciences, 
social science theories are rarely perfect, which provides numerous opportunities for 
researchers to improve those theories or b uild their own alternative theories.   
Conducting scientific research, therefor e, requires two sets of skills – theoretical  and 
methodological – needed to operate in the theoretical and empirical levels respectively.  
Methodological skills ("know -how") are  relatively standard, invariant across disciplines, and 
easily acquired through doctoral programs.  However, theoretical skills ("know -what") is 
considerably harder to master, requires years of observation and reflection, and are tacit skills 
that cannot b e “taught” but rather learned though experience.  All of the greatest scientists in 
the history of mankind, such as Galileo, Newton, Einstein, Neils Bohr, Adam Smith, Charles 

 S c i e n c e  a n d  S c i e n t i f i c  R e s e a r c h  | 5 
 
 
 Darwin, and Herbert Simon, were master theoreticians, and they are remembered for  the 
theories they postulated that transformed the course of science.  Methodological skills are 
needed to be an ordinary researcher, but theoretical skills are needed to  be an extraordinary 
researcher!  
Scientific Method  
In the preceding sections, we described science as knowledge acquired through a 
scientific method.  So what exactly is the “scientific method”?  Scientific method refers to a 
standardized set of techniques for building scientific knowledge, such as how to make valid 
observations, how to interpret results, and how to generalize those results.  The scientific 
method allows researchers to independently and impartially test preexisting theories and prior 
findings, and subject them to open debate, modifications,  or enhancements.  The scientific 
method must satisfy four characteristics:  
 Replicability:  Others should be able to independently replicate or repeat a scientific 
study and obtain similar, if not identical, results.  
 Precision:  Theoretical concepts, which a re often hard to measure, must be defined with 
such precision that others can use those definitions to measure those concepts and test 
that theory.  
 Falsifiability:   A theory must be stated in a way that it can be disproven. Theories that 
cannot be tested o r falsified are not scientific theories and any such knowledge is not 
scientific knowledge.  A theory that is specified in imprecise terms or whose concepts 
are not accurately measurable cannot be tested, and is therefore not scientific.  Sigmund 
Freud’s i deas on psychoanalysis fall into this category and is therefore not considered a 
“theory”, even though psychoanalysis may have practical utility in treating certain types 
of ailments.  
 Parsimony : When there are multiple explanations of a phenomenon, scienti sts must 
always accept the simplest or logically most economical explanation.  This concept is 
called parsimony or “Occam’s razor.”  Parsimony prevents scientists from pursuing 
overly complex or outlandish theories with endless number of concepts and 
relat ionships that may explain a little bit of everything but nothing in particular.  
Any branch of inquiry that does not allow the scientific method to test its basic laws or 
theories cannot be called “science.”  For instance, theology (the study of religion) i s not science 
because theological ideas (such as the presence of God) cannot be tested by independent 
observers using a replicable, precise, falsifiable, and parsimonious method.  Similarly, arts, 
music, literature, humanities, and law are also not conside red science, even though they are 
creative and worthwhile endeavors in their own right.  
The scientific method, as applied to social sciences, includes a variety of research 
approaches, tools, and techniques, such as qualitative and quantitative data, stati stical analysis, 
experiments, field surveys, case research, and so forth.  Most of this book is devoted to learning 
about these different methods.  However, recognize that the scientific method operates 
primarily at the empirical level of research, i.e., h ow to make observations and analyze and 
interpret these observations.  Very little of this method is directly pertinent to the theoretical 
level, which is really the more challenging part of scientific research.

 Types of Scientific Research  
Depending on the purpose of research, scientific research projects can be grouped into 
three types: exploratory, descriptive, and explanatory.  Exploratory research  is often 
conducted in new areas of inquiry, where the goals of the research are: (1) to sco pe out the 
magnitude or extent of a particular phenomenon, problem, or behavior, (2) to generate some 
initial ideas (or “hunches”) about that phenomenon, or (3) to test the feasibility of undertaking 
a more extensive study regarding that phenomenon.  For i nstance, if the citizens of a country 
are generally dissatisfied with governmental policies regarding during an economic recession, 
exploratory research may be directed at measuring the extent of citizens’ dissatisfaction, 
understanding how such dissatisfa ction is manifested, such as the frequency of public protests, 
and the presumed causes of such dissatisfaction, such as ineffective government policies in 
dealing with inflation, interest rates, unemployment, or higher taxes.  Such research may 
include exa mination of publicly reported figures, such as estimates of economic indicators, such 
as gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment, and consumer price index, as archived by 
third -party sources, obtained through interview s of experts, eminent economists , or key 
government officials, and/or derived from studying historical examples of dealing with similar 
problems.  This research may not lead to a very accurate understanding of the target problem, 
but may be worthwhile in scoping out the nature and extent of the problem and serve as a 
useful  precursor to more in -depth research.  
 Descrip tive research  is directed at making careful observation s and detailed 
documentation of a phenomenon of interest.  These observations must be based on the 
scientific method (i.e., must be replicable, precise, etc.), and therefore, are more reliable than 
casual observations by untrained people.  Examples of descriptive research are tabulation of 
demographic statistics by the United States Census Bureau or employment statistics by the 
Bureau of Labor, who use the same or similar instruments for estimating empl oyment by sector 
or population growth by ethnicity over multiple employment surveys or censuses.  If any 
changes are made to the measuring instruments, estimates are provided with and without the 
changed instrumentation to allow the readers to make a fair before -and-after comparison 
regarding population or employment trends.  Other descriptive research may include 
chronicling ethnographic reports of gang activities among adolescent youth in urban 
populations, the persistence or evolution of religious, cultu ral, or ethnic practices in select 
communities, and the role of technologies such as Twitter and instant messaging in the spread 
of democracy movements in Middle Eastern countries.   
Explanatory research  seeks explanations of observed phenomena, problems, or 
behaviors.  While descriptive research examines the what, where, and when of a phenomenon, 
explanatory research seeks answers to why and how types of questions.  It attempts to “connect 
the dots” in research, by identifying causal factors and outcomes o f the target phenomenon.  
Examples include understanding the reasons behind adolescent crime or gang violence, with 
the goal of prescribing strategies to overcome such societal ailments.  Most academic or 
doctoral research belongs to the explanation catego ry, though some amount of exploratory 
and/or descriptive research may also be needed during initial phases of academic research.  
Seeking explanations for observed events requires strong theoretical and interpretation skills, 
along with intuition, insights , and personal experience.  Those who can do it well are also the 
most prized scientists in their disciplines.

 History of Scientific Thought  
Before closing this chapter, it may be interesting to go back in history and see how 
science has evolved over ti me and identify the key scientific minds in this evolution .  Although 
instances of scientific progress  have  been documented over many centuries, the terms 
“science,” “scientists,” and the “scientific method” were coined only in the 19th century.  Prior to 
this time, science was viewed as a part of philosophy, and coexisted with other branches of 
philosophy such as logic, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics, although the boundaries between 
some of these branches were blurred.  
In the earliest days of human in quiry, knowledge was usually recognized in terms of 
theological precepts based on faith.  This was challenged by Greek philosophers such as Plato, 
Aristotle, and Socrates during the 3rd century BC, who suggested that the fundamental nature of 
being and the world can be understood more accurately through a process of systematic logical 
reasoning called rationalism .  In particular, Aristotle’s classic work Metaphysics (literally 
meaning “b eyond physical [existence]”)  separated theology  (the study of Gods) from ontology  
(the study of being and existence) and universal science  (the study of first principles, upon 
which logic is based).  Rationalism (not to be confused with “rationality”) view s reason as the 
source of knowledge or justification, and suggests that the criterion of truth is not sensory but 
rather intellectual and deductive, often derived from a set of first principles or axioms (such as 
Aristotle’s “law of non -contradiction”).   
The next major shift in scientific thought occurred during the 16th century, when British 
philosopher Francis Bacon (1561 -1626) suggested that knowledge can only be derived from 
observations in the real world.  Based on this premise, Bacon emphasized knowl edge 
acquisition as an empirical activity (rather than as a reasoning activity), and developed 
empiricism  as an influential branch of philosophy.  Bacon’s works led to the populari zation of 
inductive methods of scientific inquiry, the development of the “s cientific method” (originally 
called the “Baconian method”), consisting of systematic observation, measurement, and 
experimentation, and may have even sowed the seeds of atheism or the rejection of theological 
precepts as “unobservable.”  
Empiricism contin ued to clash with rationalism throughout the Middle Ages, as 
philosophers sought the most effective way of gaining valid knowledge.  French philosopher 
Rene Descartes sided with the rationalists, while British philosophers John Locke and David 
Hume sided w ith the empiricists.  Other scientists, such as Galileo Galilei and Sir Issac Newton, 
attempted to fuse the two ideas into natural philosophy  (the philosophy of nature), to focus 
specifically on understanding nature and the physical universe, which is cons idered to be the 
precursor of the natural sciences.  Galileo (1564 -1642) was perhaps the first to state that the 
laws of nature are mathematical, and contributed to the field of astronomy through an 
innovative combination of experimentation and mathematics . 
In the 18th century, German philosopher Immanuel Kant sought to resolve the dispute 
between empiricism and rationalism in his book Critique of Pure Reason , by arguing that 
experience is purely subjective and processing them using pure reason without firs t delving 
into the subjective nature of experiences will lead to theoretical illusions.  Kant’s ideas led to the 
development of German idealism , which inspired later development of interpretive techniques 
such as phenomenology, hermeneutics, and critical s ocial theory.

 At about the same time, French philosopher Auguste Comte  (1798 –1857), founder of 
the discipline of sociology, attempted to blend rationalism and empiricism in a new doctrine 
called positivism .  He suggested that theory and observations have c ircular dependence on 
each other.  While theories may be created via reasoning, they are only authentic if they can be 
verified through observations.  The emphasis on verification started the separation of modern 
science from philosophy and metaphysics and further development of the “scientific method” as 
the primary means of validating scientific claims.  Com te’s ideas were expanded by Emile 
Durkheim in his development of sociological positivism (positivism as a foundation for social 
research) and Ludwig Wittgenstein in logical positivism.  
In the early 20th century, strong accounts of positivism were rejected by interpretive 
sociologists (antipositivists) belonging to the German idealism school of thought.  Positivism 
was typically equated with quantitative research methods such as experiments and surveys and 
without any explicit philosophical commitments, whil e antipositivism  employed  qualitative 
methods such as unstructured interviews and participant observation.  Even practitioners of 
positivism, such as American sociologist Paul Lazarsfield who pioneered large -scale survey 
research and statistical techniques  for analyzing survey data, acknowledged potential problems 
of observer bias and structural limitations in positivist  inquiry.  In response, antipositivists 
emphasized that social actions must be studied though interpretive means based upon an 
understandin g the meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their personal actions, which 
inspired Georg Simmel’s work on symbolic interactionism, Max Weber’s work on ideal types, 
and Edmund Husserl’s work on phenomenology.   
In the mid -to-late 20th century, both  positivist and antipositivist schools of thought were 
subjected to criticisms and modifications.  British philosopher Sir Karl Popper suggested that 
human knowledge is based not on unchallengeable, rock solid foundations, but rather on a set 
of tentative conjectures that can never be proven conclusively, but only disproven.  Empirical 
evidence is the basis for disproving these conjectures or “theories.”  This metatheoretical 
stance, called  postpositivism  (or postempiricism), amends positivism by suggesting  that it is 
impossible to verify the truth although it is possible to reject false beliefs, though it retains the 
positivist  notion of an objective truth and its emphasis on the scientific method.   
Likewise, antipositivists  have also been criticized for trying only to understand society 
but not critiquing and changing society for the better.  The roots of this thought lie in Das 
Capital , written by German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which critiqued 
capitalis tic societies as being social inequitable and inefficient , and recommended resolving this 
inequity through class conflict and proletarian revolutions.  Marxism inspired social revolutions 
in countries such as Germany, Italy, Russia, and China, but generally failed to accomplish the 
social equality that it aspired .  Critical research  (also called critical theory) propounded by 
Max Horkheimer and Jurgen Habermas in the 20th century, retains similar ideas of critiquing 
and resolving social inequality, and adds that people can and should consciously act to change 
thei r social and economic circumstances, although their ability to do so is constrained by 
various forms of social, cultural and political domination.  Critical research attempts to uncover 
and critique the restrictive and alienating conditions of the status q uo by analyzing the 
oppositions, conflicts and contradictions in contemporary society, and seeks to eliminate the 
causes of alienation and domination (i.e., emancipate the oppressed class).  More on these 
different research philosophies and approaches will  be covered in future chapters of this book.

Thinking L ike a Researcher  
 
 
 Conducting good research requires first retraining your brain to think like a researcher.  
This requires visualizing the abstract from actual observations, mentally “c onnecting the dots” 
to identify hidden concepts and patterns, and synthesizing those patterns into generalizable 
laws and theories that apply to other contexts beyond the domain of the initial observations.  
Research involves constant ly moving back and forth from an empirical plane where 
observations are conducted to a theoretical plane where these observations are abstracted into 
generalizable laws and theories.  This is a skill that takes many years to develop, is not 
something that is  taught in graduate or doctoral programs or acquired in industry training, and 
is by far the biggest de ficit amongst Ph.D. students.  Some of t he mental abstractions needed to 
think like a researcher include unit of analysis, constructs, hypotheses, operat ionalization, 
theories, models, induction, deduction, and so forth, which we will examine in this chapter.   
Unit of Analysis  
 One of the first decisions in any social science research is the unit of analysis of a 
scientific study.  The unit of analysis  refers to the person, collective, or object that is the target 
of the investigation.  Typical unit of analysis include individuals, groups, organizations, 
countries, technologies, objects, and such.  For instance, if we are interested in studying people’s 
shopping behavior, their learning outcomes, or their attitudes to new technologies, then the 
unit of analysis is the individual .  If we want to study characteristics of street gangs or teamwork 
in organizations, then the unit of analysis is the group .  If th e goal of research is to understand 
how firms can improve profitability or make good executive decisions, then the unit of analysis 
is the firm .  In this case, even though decisions are made by individuals in these firms, these 
individuals are presumed to represent  their firm’s decision rather than their perso nal decisions .  
If research is directed at understanding differences in national cultures, then the unit of analysis 
becomes a country .  Even inanimate objects can serve as units of analysis.  For inst ance, if a 
researcher is interested in understanding how to make web pages more attractive to its users, 
then the unit of analysis is a web page  (and not users).  If we wish to study how knowledge 
transfer occurs between two  firms , then our unit of analysi s becomes the dyad  (the combination 
of firms that is sending and receiving knowledge).   
Understanding the units of analysis can sometimes be fairly complex.  For instance, if we 
wish to study why certain neighborhoods have high crime rates, then our unit of analysis 
becomes the neighborhood , and not crimes or criminals committing such crimes.  This is 
because the object of our inquiry is the neighborhood and not criminals.  However, if we wish to 
compare different types of crimes in different neighborhoods , such as homicide, robbery, 
10 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 assault, and so forth, our unit of analysis becomes the crime .  If we wish to study why criminals 
engage in illegal activities, then the unit of analysis becomes the individual  (i.e., the criminal).  
Like, if we want to study w hy some innovations are more successful than others, then our unit 
of analysis is an innovation .  However, if we wish to study how some organizations innovate 
more consistently than others, then the unit of analysis is the organization .  Hence, two related  
research questions within the same research study may have two entirely different units of 
analysis.  
 Understanding the unit of analysis is important because it shapes what type of data you 
should collect for your study and who you collect it from.  If yo ur unit of analysis is a web page, 
you should be collecting data about web pages from actual web pages, and not surveying people 
about how they use web pages.  If your unit of analysis is the organization, then you should be 
measuring organizational -level variables such as organizational size, revenues, hierarchy, or 
absorptive capacity.  This data may come from a variety of sources such as financial records or 
surveys of Chief Executive Officers (CEO), who are presumed to be representing their 
organization  (rather than themselves).  Some variables such as CEO pay may seem like 
individual level variables, but in fact, it can also be an organizational level variable because each 
organization has only one CEO pay at any time.  Sometimes, it is possible to coll ect data from a 
lower level of analysis and aggregate that data to a higher level of analysis.  For instance, in 
order to study teamwork in organizations, you can survey individual team members in different 
organizational teams, and average their individua l scores to create a composite team -level 
score for team -level variables like cohesion and conflict.  We will examine the notion of 
“variables” in greater depth in the next section.  
Concepts, Constructs, and Variables  
   We discussed in Chapter 1 that although research can be exploratory, descriptive, or 
explanatory, most scientific research tend to be of the explanatory type in that they search for 
potential explanations of observed natural or social phenomena.  Explana tions require 
development of concepts  or generalizable properties or characteristics associated with objects, 
events, or people.  While objects such as a person, a firm, or a car are not concepts, their specific 
characteristics or behavior such as a person ’s attitude toward immigrants, a firm’s capacity for 
innovation, and a car’s weight can be viewed as concepts.  
 Knowingly or unknowingly, we use different kinds of concepts in our everyday 
conversations.  Some of these concepts have been developed over ti me through our shared 
language.  Sometimes, we borrow concepts from other disciplines or languages to explain a 
phenomenon of interest.  For instance, the idea of gravitation  borrowed from physics can be 
used in business to describe why people tend to “gra vitate” to their preferred shopping 
destinations.  Likewise, the concept of distance  can be used to explain the degree of social 
separation between two otherwise collocated individuals.  Sometimes, we create our own 
concepts to describe a unique characteri stic not described in prior research.  For instance, 
technostress  is a new concept referring to the mental stress one may face when asked to learn a 
new technology.  
Concepts may also have progressive levels of abstraction.  Some concepts such as a 
person’s weight  are precise and objective, while other concepts such as a person’s personality  
may be more abstract and difficult to visualize.  A construct  is an abstract c oncept that is 
specifically chosen (or “created”) to explain a given phenomenon.  A construct may be a simple 
concept, such as a person’s weight , or a combination of a set of related concepts such as a 
T h i n k i n g  L i k e  a  R e s e a r c h e r  | 11 
 
 
 person’s communication skill , which may consist of sev eral underlying concepts such as the 
person’s vocabulary, syntax , and spelling .  The former instance (weight) is a  unidimensional 
construct , while the latter ( communication skill ) is a multi -dimensional  construct  (i.e., it 
consists of multiple underlying c oncepts).  The distinction between constructs and concepts are 
clearer in multi -dimensional constructs, where the higher order abstraction is called a construct 
and the lower order abstractions are called concepts.  However, this distinction tends to blur in 
the case of unidimensional constructs.  
Constructs used for scientific research must have precise and clear definitions that 
others can use to understand exactly what it means and what it does not mean.  For instance, a 
seemingly simple construct such as  income  may refer to monthly or annual income, before -tax 
or after -tax income, and personal or family income, and is therefore neither precise nor clear.  
There are two types of definitions: dictionary definitions and operational definitions.  In the 
more familia r dictionary definition, a construct is often defined in terms of a synonym.  For 
instance, attitude may be defined as a disposition, a feeling, or an affect, and affect in turn is 
defined as an attitude.  Such definitions of a circular nature are not part icularly useful in 
scientific research for elaborating the meaning and content of that construct.  Scientific research 
requires operational definitions  that define constructs in terms of how they will be 
empirically measured.  For instance, the operational  definition of a construct such as 
temperature  must specify whether we plan to measure temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or 
Kelvin scale.  A construct such as income  should be defined in terms of whether we are 
interested in monthly or annual income, bef ore-tax or after -tax income, and personal or family 
income.  One can imagine that constructs such as learning , personality , and intelligence  can be 
quite hard to define operationally.  
 
Figure 2.1.  The theoretical and empirical planes  of research  
 
A term  frequently associated with, and sometimes used interchangeably with, a 
construct is a variable.  Etymologically speaking, a variable is a quantity that can vary (e.g., from 
low to high, negative to positive, etc.), in contrast to constants that do not var y (i.e., remain 
constant).  However, in scientific research, a variable  is a measurable representation of an 
abstract construct.  As abstract entities, constructs are not directly measurable, and hence, we 
look for proxy measures called variables.  For ins tance, a person’s intelligence  is often measured 
as his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score , which is an index generated from an analytical and 
pattern -matching test administered to people.  In this case, intelligence  is a construct, and IQ 
score  is a variable that measure s the intelligence construct.  Whether IQ scores truly measures 
one’s intelligence is anyone’s guess (though many believe that they do), and depending on 

12 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 whether how well it measures intelligence, the IQ score may be a good or a poor measure of the 
intelligence construct.  As shown in Figure 2.1, scientific research proceeds along two planes: a 
theoretical plane and an empirical plane.  Constructs are conce ptualized at the theoretical 
(abstract) plane, while variables are operationalized and measured at the empirical 
(observational) plane.  Thinking like a researcher implies the ability to move back and forth 
between these two planes.   
Depending on their int ended use, variables may be classified as independent, 
dependent, moderating, mediating, or control variables.  Variables that explain other variables 
are called independent variables , those that are explained by other variables are dependent 
variables , those that are explained by independent variables while also explaining dependent 
variables are mediating variables  (or intermediate  variables), and those that influence the 
relationship between independent and dependent variables are called moderating varia bles .  
As an example, if we state that higher intelligence causes improved learning among students, 
then intelligence is an independent variable and learning is a dependent variable.  There may be 
other extraneous variables that are not pertinent to explai ning a given dependent variable, but 
may have some impact on the dependent variable.  These variables must be controlled for in a 
scientific study, and are therefore called control variables . 
 
Figure 2.2.  A nomological network of constructs  
 
To understan d the differences between these different variable types, consider the 
example shown in Figure 2.2.  If we believe that intelligence influences (or explains) students’ 
academic achievement , then a measure of intelligence such as an IQ score  is an independe nt 
variable, while a measure of academic success such as grade point average  is a dependent 
variable.  If we believe that the effect of intelligence on academic achievement  also depends on 
the effort invested by the student in the learning process (i.e., between two equally intelligent 
students, the student who puts is more effort achieves higher academic achievement  than one 
who puts in less effort), then effort  becomes a m oderating variable.  Incidentally, one may also 
view effort as an independent variable and intelligence as a moderating variable.  If academic 
achievement  is viewed as an intermediate step to higher earning  potential, then earning 
potential  becomes  the dep endent variable for the independent variable academic achievement , 
and academic achievement  becomes the mediating variable in the relationship between 
intelligence and earning  potential.  Hence, variable are defined as an independent, dependent, 
mode rating , or mediating variable based on the ir nature of association  with each other .  The 
overall network of relationships between a set of related constructs is called a nomological 
network  (see Figure 2.2).  Thinking like a researcher requires  not only being ab le to abstract 
constructs from observations, but also being able to mentally visualize a nomological network 
linking these abstract constructs.

 Propositions and Hypotheses  
Figure 2.2 shows how theoretical constructs such as intelligence, effort, academic  
achievement, and earning potential are related to each other in a nomological network.  Each of 
these relationships is called a proposition.  In seeking explanations to a given phenomenon or 
behavior, it is not adequate just to identify key concepts and c onstructs underlying the target 
phenomenon or behavior.  We must also identify and state patterns of relationships between 
these constructs.  Such patterns of relationships are called propositions.  A proposition  is a 
tentative and conjectural relationship between constructs that is stated in a declarative form .  
An example of a proposition is: “A n increase in student intelligence causes an increas e in their 
academic achievement .”  This declarative statement does not have to be true, but must be 
empirically testable using data, so that we can judge  whether it is true or false .  Propositions are 
generally derived based on  logic (deduction) or empirical observations (induction).   
Because  propositions are association s between abstract constructs, they cannot be 
tested directly.  Instead, they are tested indirectly by examining the relationship between 
corresponding measures  (variables ) of those constructs.  The empirical formulation of 
propositions, stated as relation ships between variables, is called hypotheses  (see Figure 2.1).  
Since IQ scores and grade point average are operational measures of intelligence and academic 
achievement  respectively , the above p roposition can be specified in form of the hypothesis: “An 
increase in students’ IQ score causes an increas e in their grade point average .”  Propositions are 
specified in the theoretical plane, while hypotheses are specified in the empirical plane .  Hence, 
hypotheses are empirically testable  using observed data , and may be rejected if not supported 
by empirical observations.  Of course, the goal of hypothesis testing is to infer whether the 
corresponding proposition is valid . 
Hypotheses can be stron g or weak.  “Students’ IQ scores are related to their academic 
achie vement” is an example of a weak hypothesis, since it indicates neither the directionality of 
the hypothesis (i.e., whether the relationship is positive or negative), nor its causality (i.e., 
whether intelligence causes academic achievement or academic achi evement causes 
intelligence).  A stronger hypothesis is “students’ IQ score s are positively  related to their 
academic achievement”, which indicates the directionality but not the causality.  A still better 
hypothesis is “students’ IQ score s have  positive effect s on their academic achievement”, which 
specifies both the directionality and the causality (i.e., intelligence causes academic 
achievement, and not the reverse).   The signs in Figure 2.2 indicate the directionality of the 
respective hypoth eses.   
Also note that scientific hypotheses should clearly specify independent and dependent 
variables.   In the hypothesis, “students’ IQ score s have  positive effect s on their academic 
achievement,”  it is clear that intelligence is the independent variab le (the “cause”) and academic 
achievement is the dependent variable (the “effect”).  Further, it is also clear that this 
hypothesis can be evaluated as either true (if higher intelligence leads to higher academic 
achievement) or false (if higher intelligen ce has no effect on or leads to lower academic 
achievement).  Later on in this book, we will examine how to empirically test such cause -effect 
relationships.  Statements such as “students are generally intelligent” or “all students can 
achieve academic suc cess” are not scientific hypotheses because the y do not specify  
independent and dependent variables, nor do they specify a directional relationship that can be 
evaluated as true or false.

 Theories and Models  
A theory  is a set of systematically interrelate d constructs and propositions intended  to 
explain and predict a phenomenon or behavior of interest, within certain boundary conditions 
and assumptions.  Ess entially, a theory is a system ic collection of related theoretical 
propositions.  While propositions generally connect two or three constructs, theories represent 
a system  of multiple constructs and propositions.  Hence, theories can be substantially more 
complex and abstract and of a larger scope than proposi tions or hypotheses.   
I must note here that people not familiar with scientific research often view a theory as 
a speculation  or the opposite of fact.  For instance, people often say that teachers need to be less 
theoretical and more practical or factual in their classroom teaching.  However, practice or fact 
are not opposites of theory, but in a scientific sense, are essential components needed to test 
the validity of a theory.  A good scientific theory should be well supported using observed facts 
and sh ould also have practical value, while a poorly defined theory tends to be lacking in these 
dimensions.  Famous organizational research Kurt Lewin once said, “Theory without practice is 
sterile; practice without theory is blind .”  Hence, both theory and fac ts (or practice) are 
essential for scientific research.   
Theories provide explanations of social or natural phenomenon.  A s emphasized in 
Chapter 1, these  explanations may be good or poor.  Hence , there may be good or poor theories.  
Chapter 3 describes s ome criteria that can be used to evaluate how good a theory really is.  
Nevertheless, it is important for researchers to understand that theory is not “truth,” there is 
nothing sacrosanct about any theory, and theories should not be accepted just because  they 
were proposed by someone.  I n th e course of scientific progress, p oorer theories are eventually 
replaced by better theories with higher explanatory power.  The essential challenge for 
researchers is to build better and more comprehensive theories that can explain a target 
phenomenon better than prior theories.  
A term often used in conjunction with theory is a model.  A model  is a representation of 
all or part of a system that is constructed to study that  system  (e.g., how the system works or 
what triggers the system) .  While a theory tries to explain a phenomenon , a model tries to 
represent a phenomenon .  Models are often used by decision makers to make important 
decisions based on a given set of inputs.  For in stance, marketing managers may use models to 
decide how much money to spend on advertising for different product lines  based on 
parameters such as prior year’s advertising expenses, sales , market growth, and competing 
products.  Likewise, weather forecaste rs can use models to predict future weather patterns 
based on parameters such as wind speeds, wind direction, temperature, and humidity .  While 
these models are useful, they may not necessarily explain advertising expenditure or weather 
forecasts.  Models may be of different kinds, such as mathematical models, n etwork models, and 
path models.   Models can also be descriptive, predictive, or normative.  Descriptive models are 
frequently used for representing complex systems, for visualizing  variables and rela tionships in 
such systems.  An advertising expenditure model may be a descriptive model.  Predictive 
models (e.g., a regression model) a llow forecast of future events.  Weather  forecasting models 
are predictive models .  Normative models are used to guide our activities along commonly 
accepted norms or practices.   Models may also be static if it represent s the state of a system at 
one point in time, or dynamic, if it represents  a system’s evolution over time.   
The process of theory or model development may  involve  inductive and deductive 
reasoning.  Recall from Chapter 1 that deduction  is the process of drawing conclusions about a 
T h i n k i n g  L i k e  a  R e s e a r c h e r  | 15 
 
 
 phenomenon or behavior based on theoretical or logical reasons and an initial set of premises.  
As an example, if a certain bank  enforces a strict code of ethics for its employees (Premise 1) 
and Jamie is an employee at that bank (Premise 2), then Jamie can be trusted to follow ethical 
practices (Conclusion).  In deduction, the conclusions must be true if the initial premises and 
reasons are correct.   
In contrast, induction  is the process of drawing conclusions based on facts or observed 
evidence.  For instance, if a firm spent a lot of money on a promotional campaign (Observation 
1), but the sales did not increase (Observation 2),  then possibly the promotion campaign was 
poorly executed  (Conclusion) .  However, there may be rival explanations for poor sales, such as 
economic recession or the emergence of a competing product or brand or perhaps a supply 
chain  problem .  Inductive conc lusions are therefore only a hypothesis, and may be disproven.  
Deductive conclusions generally tend to be stronger than inductive conclusions , but a deductive 
conclusion based on an incorrect premise is also incorrect .   
As shown in Figure 2.3 , inductive and deductive reasoning go hand in hand in theory 
and model building.  Induction occurs when we observe a fact and ask, “Why is this happening?”  
In answering this question, we advance one or more tentative explanations (hypotheses).  We 
then use deduction  to narrow down the tentative explanations to the most plausible 
explanation based on logic and reasonable premise s (based on our understanding of the  
phenomenon under study ).  Researchers must be able to move back and forth between 
inductive and deductive  reasoning if they are to post extensions or modifications to a given 
model or theory, or built better  ones , which are the essence of scientific research.

The Research Process  
 
 
In Chapter 1, we saw that scientific research is the process of acquiring scientific 
knowledge using the scientific method.  But how is such research conducted?  This chapter 
delves into the process of scientific research, and the assumptions and outcomes of the research 
process.  
Paradigms of Social Research  
Our design and conduct of research is shaped by our mental models or frames of 
references that we use to organize our reasoning and obser vations.  These mental models or 
frames (belief systems) are called paradigms .  The word “paradigm” was popularized by 
Thomas Kuhn (1962) in his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , where he examined the 
history of the natural sciences  to identify  patterns of activities that shape the progress of 
science.  S imilar ideas are applicable to social sciences as well, where a social reality can be 
viewed by different people in different ways, which may constrain their thinking and reasoning  
about the observed phenomenon .  For instance, conservatives and liberals tend to have very 
different perceptions of the role of government in people’s lives, and hence, have different 
opinions on how to solve social problems.  Conservatives may believe th at lowering taxes is the 
best way to stimulate  a stagnant economy because it increases people’s disposable income and 
spending, which in turn expands business output and employment.  In contrast, liberals may 
believe that governments should invest more dir ectly in job creation programs such as public 
works and infrastructure projects , which will increase employment and people’s ability to 
consume and drive the economy .  Likewise, Western societies place greater emphasis on 
individual rights, such as one’s r ight to privacy, right of free speech, and right to bear arms.  In 
contrast, Asian societies tend to balance the rights of individuals against the rights of families, 
organizations, and the government, and therefore tend to be more communal and less 
indivi dualistic in their policies.  Such differences in perspective often lead Westerners to 
criticize Asian governments for being autocratic , while Asians criticize Western societies for 
being greed y, having high crime rates, and creating a “cult of the individ ual.”  Our personal 
paradigms are like “colored glasses” tha t govern how we view the world and how we structure 
our thoughts  about what we see in the world .   
Paradigms are often hard to recognize, because they are implicit, assumed, and taken 
for granted.   However, recognizing these paradigms is key to making sense of and reconciling 
differences in people’ perception s of the same social phenomenon.  For instance, why do 
liberals believe that the best way to improve secondary education is to hire more teach ers, but 
conservatives believe that privatizing education (using such means as school vouchers) are 
18 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 more effective in achieving the same goal?  Because conservatives place more faith in 
competitive markets (i.e., in free competition between schools competi ng for education dollars), 
while liberals believe more in labor (i.e., in having more teachers and schools).  Likewise, in 
social science research, if one were to understand why a certain technology was successfully 
implemented in one organization but fail ed miserably in another, a researcher looking at the 
world through a “rational lens” will look for rational explanations of the problem such as 
inadequate technology or poor fit between technology and the task context where it is being 
utilized, while anot her research looking at the same problem through a “social lens” may seek 
out social deficiencies such as inadequate user training or lack of management support, while 
those seeing it through a “political lens” will look for instances of organizational pol itics that 
may subvert the technology implementation process.  Hence, subconscious paradigms often 
constrain the concepts that researchers attempt to measure, their observations, and their 
subsequent interpretations of  a phenomenon .  However, given the com plex nature of social 
phenomenon, it is possible that all of the above paradigms are partially correct, and that a fuller 
understanding of the problem may require an understanding and application of multiple 
paradigms.  
Two popular paradigms today among soc ial science researchers are positivism and 
post -positivism.  Positivism , based on the works of French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798 -
1857), was the dominant scientific paradigm until the mid -20th century.  It holds that science or 
knowledge creation shoul d be restricted to wha t can be observed and measured.  Positivism 
tends to rely exclusively on theories that can be directly tested.  Though positivism was 
originally an attempt to separate scientific inquiry from religion (where the precepts could not 
be objectively observed), positivism led to empiricism  or a blind faith in observed data and a 
rejection of any attempt to extend or reason beyond observable facts.  Since human thoughts 
and emotions could not be directly measured, there were not considered t o be legitimate topics 
for scientific research .  Frustrations with the strictly empirical nature of positivist philosophy 
led to the development of post -positivism  (or postmodernism) during the mid -late 20th 
century.  Post -positivism argues that one can ma ke reasonable inferences about a phenomenon 
by combining empirical observations with logical reasoning.  Post -positivists view science as 
not certain but probabilistic  (i.e., based on many contingencies ), and often seek to explore these 
contingencies to understand social reality  better .  The post -positivist camp has further 
fragmented into subjectivists , who view the world as a subjective construction of our subjective 
minds rather than as an objective reality, and critical  realists , who believe that ther e is an 
external reality that is independent of a person’s thinking but we can never know such reality 
with any degree of certainty.   
Burrell and Morgan (1979), in their seminal book Sociological Paradigms and 
Organizational Analysis , suggested that the w ay social science researchers view and study social 
phenomena is shaped by two fundamental sets of philosophical assumptions: ontology and 
epistemology.  Ontology refers to our assumptions about how we see the world, e.g., does the 
world consist mostly of social order or constant change.  Epistemology refers to our 
assumptions about the best way to study the world, e.g., should we use an objective or 
subjective approach to study social reality.  Using these two sets of assumptions, we can 
categorize social science research as belonging to one of  four categories (see Figure 3.1 ). 
If researchers view the world as consisting mostly of social order (ontology) and hence 
seek to study patterns of ordered events or behaviors, and believe that the best way to study 
such a world is using objective approach (epistemology) that is independent of the person 
conducting the  observation or interpretation, such as by using standardized dat a collection 
T h e  R e s e a r c h  P r o c e s s  | 19 
 
 
 tools like surveys , then they are adopting a paradigm of functionalism .  H owever, if they 
believe that the best way to study social order is though the subjective interpretation of 
participants  involved, such as by interviewing different participants and reconciling differences 
among their responses usin g their own subjective pe rspectives , then they are employing an 
interpretivism  paradigm.  If researchers believe that the world consists of radical change and 
seek to understand or enact change using an objectivist approach, then they are employing a 
radical structuralism  paradigm .  If they wish to understand social change using the subjective 
perspectives of the participants  involved, then they are following a radical humanism  
paradigm.  
 
Figure 3.1.  Four paradigms of social science research  
(Source: Burrell and Morgan , 1979)  
 
To date, t he major ity of social science research has emulated the natural sciences, and 
followed the functionalist paradigm.  Functionalists believe that social order or patterns can be 
understood in terms of their functional components, and therefore attemp t to break  down a 
problem into small components and studying one or more components in detail using 
objectivist techniques such as surveys and experimental research.  However, with the 
emergence of post -positivist  thinking, a small but growing number of social science researchers 
are attempting to understand social order using subjectivist techniques such as interviews and 
ethnographic studies.  Radical humanism and radical structuralism continues to represent a 
negligible proportion of social science research, because scientists are primarily concerned with 
understanding generalizable patterns of behavior, events, or phenomena, rather than 
idiosyncratic or changing events.  Nevertheless, if you wish to study social  change, such as why 
democratic movements are increasingly emerging in Middle Eastern countries, or why this 
movement was successful in Tunisia , took a longer path to success in Libya, and is still not 
successful in Syria, then perhaps radical humanism is the right approach for such a study.  
Social and organizational phenomena generally consists elements of both order and change.  
For instance, organizational success depends on formalized business processes, work 
procedures, and job responsibilities,  while  being simultaneously constrained by a constantly 
changing mix of competitors, competing products, suppliers, and customer base in the business 
environment.  Hence, a holistic and more complete und erstanding of social phenomena such as 
why are some organiz ations more successful than others , require an appreciation and 
application of a multi -paradigmatic approach to research.

 Overview of the Research Process  
So how do our mental paradigms shape social science research?  At its core, all scientific 
research i s an iterative process of observation, rationalization, and validation.  In the 
observation  phase, we observe a natural or social phenomenon, event, or behavior that 
interests us.  In the rationalization phase, we try to make sense of or the observed 
pheno menon, event, or behavior by logically connecting the different pieces of the puzzle that 
we observe, which in some cases, may lead to the construction of a theory.  Finally, in the 
validation  phase, we test our theories using a scientific method through a  process of data 
collection and analysis, and in doing so, possibly modify or extend our initial theory.  However, 
research designs vary based on whether the researcher starts at observation and attempts to 
rationalize the observations (inductive research) , or whether the researcher starts at an ex ante 
rationalization or a theory and attempts to validate the theory (deductive research).  Hence, the 
observation -rationalization -validation cycle is very similar to the induction -deduction cycle of 
research dis cussed in Chapter 1.  
Most traditional research tends to be deductive and functi onalistic in nature.  Figure 3.2  
provides a schematic view of such a research project.  This figure depicts a series of activities to 
be performed in functionalist research, cat egorized into three phases: exploration, research 
design, and research execution.  Note that this generalized design is not a roadmap or flowchart 
for all research.  It applies only to functionalistic research, and it can and should be modified to 
fit the needs of a specific project.

The first phase of research is exploration .  This phase includes exploring and selecting 
research questions for further investigation , exam ining the published literature i n the area of 
inquiry to understand the current state of knowledge in that area, and identifying theories that 
may help answer the research questions of interest.   

T h e  R e s e a r c h  P r o c e s s  | 21 
 
 
 The first step in the exploration phase is identifying one or more research questions  
deali ng with a specific behavior, event, or phenomena of interest.  Research questions are 
specific questions about a behavior, event, or phenomena of interest that you wish to seek 
answers for in your research.  E xamples  include  what factors motivate consumers  to purchase 
goods and services online without knowing  the vendors of these goods or services, how can we 
make high school students more creative, and why do some people commit terrorist acts.  
Research questions can delve into issues of what, why, how, wh en, and so forth.  More 
interesting research questions are those that appeal to a broader population (e.g., “how can 
firms innovate” is a more interesting research question than “how can Chinese firms innovate in 
the service -sector”) , address  real and comp lex problems ( in contrast to hypothetical or “toy” 
problems), and where the answers are not obvious.  Narrowly focused research questions 
(often with a binary yes/no answer) tend to be le ss useful and less interesting and less suited to 
capturing the subtl e nuances of social pheno mena .  Uninteresting research questions generally 
lead to uninteresting and unpublishable  research findings.  
The next step is to conduct a literature review  of the domain of interest.  The purpose 
of a literature review is three -fold: (1) to survey the current state of knowledge in the area of 
inquiry, (2) to identify key authors, articles, theories, and findings in that area, and (3) to 
identify gaps in know ledge in that research area.  Literature review is commonly done today 
using c omputerized keyword searches in online databases.  Keywords can be combined using 
“and” and “or” operations to narrow down or expand the search results.  Once a shortlist of 
rele vant articles is generated from the keyword search, t he researcher must then manua lly 
browse through each article, or at least  its abstract section, to determine the suitability of that 
article for a detailed review.  Literature review s should be reasonabl y complete, and not 
restricted to a few journals, a few years, or a specific methodology.  Reviewed articles may be 
summarized in the form of table s, and can be further structured  using organizing frameworks 
such as a concept matrix .  A well -conducted lite rature review should indicate whether the initial 
research questions have already been addressed in the literature (which would obviate the 
need to study them again), whether there are new er or more interesting research  questions 
available , and whether the original research questions should be modified or changed in light of  
findings of the literature review .  The review can also provide some intuitions or potential 
answers to the questions of interest and/or help identify theories that have previously been  
used to address similar questions.  
Since functionalist ( deductive ) research involves theory -testing, the third step is to 
identify one or more theories  can help address  the desired research questions.  While the 
literature review may uncover a wide range  of concepts or constructs potentially related to the 
phenomenon of interest, a theory will help identify which of these constructs is logically 
relevant to the target phenomenon and how.  Forgoing theories may result in measuring a wide 
range of less rele vant, marginally relevant, or irrelevant constructs, while also minimizing the 
chances of obtaining results that are meaningful and not by pure chance.  In functionalist 
research, theories can be used as the logical basis for postulating hypotheses for emp irical 
testing.  Obviously, not all theories are well -suited for studying all social phenomena.  Theories 
must be carefully selected based on their fit with the target problem and the extent to which 
their assumptions are consistent with that of the target  problem.  We will examine theories and 
the process of theorizing in detail in the next chapter.  
The next phase  in the research process is research design .  This process is concerned 
with creating a blueprint of the activities to take in order to satisfact orily answer  the research 
22 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 questions  identified in the exploration phase .  This includes selecting a research method, 
operationalizing constructs of interest, and devising an appropriate sampling strategy.   
Operationalization  is the process of designing pr ecise measures for abstract 
theoretical constructs.  This is a major problem in social science research, given that many of 
the constructs, such as prejudice, alienation, and liberalism are hard to define, let alone 
measure accurately.  Operationalization starts with specify ing an “operational definition” (or 
“conceptualization” ) of the constructs of interest .  Next, the researcher can search the literature 
to see if there are existing prevalidated measures matching their operational definition that can 
be used directly or modified to measure their constructs of interest .  If such measures are not 
available or if existing measures are poor or reflect a different conceptualization than that 
intended by the researcher, new instruments may have to be designed f or measuring those 
constructs.  This means specifying exactly how exactly the desired construct will be measured 
(e.g., how many items, what items, and so forth).  This can easily be a long and laborious 
process, with multiple rounds of pretests and modifi cations before the newly designed 
instrument can be accepted as “scientifically valid.”  We will discuss operationalization of 
constructs in a future chapter on measurement.  
Simultaneously with operationalization, the researcher must also decide what research 
method  they wish to employ for collecting data to address the ir research questions of interest.  
Such methods may include quantitative  methods such as experiments or survey research or 
qualitative methods such as case research or action research, or possibly a combination of both.  
If an experiment is desired, then what is the experimental design?  If survey, do you plan a mail 
survey, telephone survey, web survey, or a combination?  For complex, uncertain, and multi -
faceted social phenomena, multi -method approaches may be more suitable, which may help 
leverage the unique strengths of each research method and generate insights that may not be 
obtained using a single method.   
Researchers must also carefully choose the  target population from which th ey wish to 
collect data, and a sampling  strategy to select a sample from that population.  For instance, 
should they survey individuals or fi rms or workgroups within firms?  W hat types of individuals 
or firms they wish to target?  Sampling strategy is clos ely related to the unit of analysis in a 
research problem.  While selecting a sample, reasonable care should be taken to avoid a biased 
sample (e.g., sample based on convenience) that may generate biased observations.  Sampling is 
covered in depth in a lat er chapter.  
At this stage, it is often a good idea to write a research proposal  detailing all of the 
decisions made in the preceding stages of the research process and the rationale behind each 
decision.  This multi -part proposal should address what resear ch questions you wish to study 
and why, the prior state of knowledge in this area, theories you wish to employ along with 
hypotheses to be tested, how to measure constructs, what research method to be employed and 
why, and desired sampling strategy.  Fundi ng agencies typically require such a proposal in 
order to select the best proposals for funding.  Even if funding is not sought for a research 
project, a proposal may serve as a  useful  vehicle for seeking feedback from other researchers 
and identifying pot ential problems with the research project (e.g., whether some important 
constructs were missing from the study) before starting data collection.  This initial feedback is 
invaluable because it is often too late to correct critical problems after data is co llected in a 
research study . 
T h e  R e s e a r c h  P r o c e s s  | 23 
 
 
 Having decided who to study (subjects), what to measure (concepts), and how to collect 
data (research method), the researcher is now ready to proceed to the research execution  
phase.  This includes pilot testing the measurement  instruments, data collection, and data 
analysis.   
Pilot testing  is an often overlooked but extremely important part of the research 
process.  It helps detect potential problems in your research design and/or instrumentation 
(e.g., whether the questions a sked is intelligible to the targeted sample), and to ensure that the 
measurement instruments used in the study are reliable and valid measures of the constructs of 
interest.  The pilot sample is usually a small subset of the target population.  After a suc cessful 
pilot testing, the researcher may then proceed with data collection  using the sampled 
population.  The data collected may be quantitative or qualitative, depending on the research 
method employed.   
Following  data collection , the data is analyzed and interpreted for the purpose of 
drawing conclusions regarding the research questions of interest.  Depending on the type of 
data collected (quantitative or qualitative), data analysis  may be quantitative (e.g., employ 
statistical techniques suc h as regression or structural equation modeling ) or qualitative (e.g., 
coding  or content analysis ). 
The final phase of research involves preparing the final research report  documenting 
the entire research process and its findings in the form of a research paper, dissertation, or 
monograph.  This report should outline in detail all the choices made during the research 
process (e.g., theory used, constructs selected, measures used, research methods, sampling, etc.) 
and why, as well as the outcome s of each pha se of the research process.  The research process 
must be described in sufficient detail so as to allow other researchers to replicate your study, 
test the findings, or assess whether the inferences derived are scientifically acceptable.  Of 
course, having  a ready research proposal will greatly simplify and quicken the process of 
writing the finished report.  Note that research is of no value unless the research process and 
outcomes are doc umented for future generations; such documentation is essential for the 
incremental progress of science.  
Common Mistakes in Research  
 The research process is fraught with problems and pitfalls, and novice researcher s often 
find, after invest ing substantial amount s of time and effort into a research  project , that their 
rese arch questions were not sufficiently answered , or that the findings were not interesting 
enough,  or that the research was not of “a cceptable” scientific quality.  Such problems typically 
result in research papers being rejected by journal s.  Some of the  more frequent mistakes are 
described below.  
 Insufficiently motivated research questions.   Often times, we choose our “pet” 
problems that are interesting to us but not to the scientific community at large , i.e., it does not 
generate new knowledge or insight about the phenomenon being investigated .  Because the 
research process involves a significant investment of time and effort on the researcher’s part, 
the researcher must be certain (and be able to convince others) that the research questions 
they seek to a nswer in fact deal with real problems (and not hypothetical problems) that affect 
a substantial portion of a population and has not been adequately addressed in prior research.  
24 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
  Pursuing research fads.   Another common mistake is pursuing “popular” topics w ith 
limited shelf life.  A typical example is studying technologies or practices that are popular today.  
Because research takes several years to complete and publish, it is possible that popular 
interest in these fads may die down by the time the research  is completed and submitted for 
publication.  A better strategy may be to study “timeless” topics that have alw ays persisted 
through the years .   
 Unresearchable problems.   Some research problems may not be answered adequately 
based on observed evidence al one, or using currently accepted methods and procedures.  Such 
problems are best avoided.  However, some unresearchable, ambiguously defined problems 
may be modified or fine tuned into well -defined and useful researchable problems.  
 Favored research method s.  Many researchers have a tendency to recast a research 
problem so that it is amenable to their favorite research method (e.g., survey research).  This is 
an unfortunate trend.  Research methods should be chosen to best fit a research problem, and 
not th e other way around.  
 Blind data mining.   Some  researchers have the tendency to collect data first (using 
instruments that are already available), and then figure out what to do with it.  Note that data 
collection is only one step in a long and elaborate process of planning, designing, and executing 
research.  In fact, a series of other activities are needed in a research process prior to data 
collection.  If researchers jump into data collection without such elaborate planning, the data 
collected will likely be irrelevant, imperfect, or useless, and t heir data collection efforts may be 
entirely wasted.  An abundance of data cannot make up for deficits in research planning and 
design, and particularly, for the lack of interesting research questions.

Theories in Scientific Research  
 
 
 As we know from previous chapters, science is knowledge represented as a collection of 
“theories” derived using the scientific method.  In this chapter, we will examine what is a 
theory, why do we need theories in research, what are the building blocks of a theory, how to 
evaluate theories, how can we apply theories in research, and also presents illustrative 
examples of five theories frequently used in social science research.  
Theories  
Theories are explanations of a natural or social behavior, event, or phenomenon.  More 
formally, a scientific theory is a system of constructs (concepts) and propositions (relationships 
between those constructs) that collectively presents a logical, system atic, and coherent 
explanation of a phenomenon of interest within some assumptions and boundary conditions 
(Bacharach 1989).1   
Theories should explain  why things happen, rather than just describe or predict .  Note 
that it is possible to predict events or behaviors using a set of predictors, without necessarily 
explaining why such events are taking place.  For instance, market analysts predict fluctuations 
in the stock market based on market announcements, earnings reports of major companies, and 
new data f rom the Federal Reserve and other agencies, based on previously observed 
correlations .  Prediction requires only correlations.  In contrast, explanations require causations , 
or understanding of cause -effect relationships.  Establishing causation requires t hree 
conditions: (1) correlations between two constructs, (2) temporal precedence (the cause must 
precede the effect in time), and (3) rejection of alternative hypotheses (through testing).  
Scientific theories are different from theological, philosophical , or other explanations in that 
scientific theories can be empirically tested using scientific methods.   
Explanations can be idiographic or nomothetic.  Idiographic explanations  are those 
that explain a single situation or event in idiosyncratic detail.  For example, you did poorly on an 
exam because: (1) you forgot that you had an exam on that day, (2) you arrived late to the exam 
due to a traffic jam, (3) you panicked midway through the exam, (4) you had to work late the 
previous evening  and could not st udy for the exam, or even (5) your dog ate your text book.  
The explanations may be detailed, accurate, and valid, but they may not apply to other similar 
situations, even involving the same person, and are hence not generalizable.  In contrast,

Management Review  (14:4), 496 -515.  
26 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 nomothetic  explanations  seek to explain a class of situations or events rather than a specific 
situation or event.  For example, students who do poorly in exams do so because they did not 
spend adequate time preparing for exams or that they suffer from nervousness, attention -
deficit, or some other medical disorder.  Because nomothetic explanations are designed to be 
generalizable across situations, events, or people, they tend to be less precise, less complete, 
and less detailed.  However, they explain economically, using only a few explanatory variables.  
Because theories are also intended to serve as generalized explanations for patterns of events, 
behaviors, or phenomena, theoretical explanations are generally nomothetic in nature.  
While understanding theories, it is also important to understand what theory is not.  
Theory is not data, facts, typologies, taxonomies, or empirical findings.  A collection of facts is 
not a theory, just as a pile of stone s is not a house.  Likewise, a collection of constructs ( e.g., a 
typology  of constructs ) is not a theory, because theories must go well beyond constructs to 
include propositions, explanations, and boundary conditions.  Data, facts, and findings operate 
at the empirical or observational level, while theories operate at a conceptual level and are 
based on logic rather than observations.  
There are many benefits to using theories in research.  First, theories provide the 
underlying logic of the occurrence of natural or social phenomenon by explaining what are the 
key drivers and key outcomes of the target phenomenon and why, and what underlying 
processes are responsible driving that phenomenon.  Second, they aid in sense -making by 
helping us synthesize prior empirical findings within a theoretical framework and reconcile 
contr adictory findings by discovering contingent factors influencing the relationship between 
two constructs in different studies.   Third, theories provide guidance for future research by 
helping identify constructs and relationships that are worthy of further  research.  Fourth, 
theories can contribute to cumulative knowledge building by bridging gaps between other 
theories and by causing existing theories to be reevaluated in a new light.  
However, theories can also have their own share of limitations.  As simp lified 
explanations of reality, theories may not always provide adequate explanation s of the 
phenomenon of interest based on a limited set of constructs and relationships.  Theori es are 
designed to be simple  and parsimonious explanations, while reality may  be significantly more 
complex.  Furthermore, theories may impose blinders or limit researchers’ “range of vision,” 
causing them to miss out on important concepts that are not defined by the theory.   
Building Blocks of a Theory  
 David Whetten  (1989) suggests that there are four building blocks of a theory: 
constructs, propositions, logic, and boundary conditions/assumptions .  Constructs capture the 
“what” of theories (i.e., what concepts are important for explaining a phenomenon), 
propositions  capture the “how” (i.e., how are these concepts related to each other), logic 
represents the “why” (i.e., why are these concepts related), and boundary 
conditions/assumptions examines the “who, when, and where” (i.e., under what circumstances 
will these c oncepts and relationships work).  Though constructs and propositions were 
previously discussed in Chapter 2, we describe them again here for the sake of completeness.  
 Constructs  are abstract concepts specified at a high level of abstraction that are chose n 
specifically to explain the phenomenon of interest.  Recall from Chapter 2 that constructs may 
be unidimensional ( i.e., embody a single concept), such as weight or age, or multi -dimensional 
(i.e., embody multiple underlying concepts), such as personality  or culture.  While s ome 
T h e o r i e s  i n  S c i e n t i f i c  R e s e a r c h  | 27 
 
 
 constructs, such as age, education, and firm size, are easy to understand, others, such as 
creativity, prejudice, and organizational agility, may be more complex and abstruse, and still 
others such as trust, attitude, and learning,  may represent temporal tendencies rather than 
steady states.  Nevertheless , all constructs must have clear and unambiguous operational 
definition that should specify exactly how the construct will be measured and at what level of 
analysis (individual, gro up, organizational, etc.).  Measurable representations of abstract 
constructs are called variables .  For instance, intelligence quotient (IQ score) is a variable that 
is purported to measure an abstract construct called intelligence.  As noted earlier, sci entific 
research proceeds along two planes: a theoretical plane and an empirical plane.  Constructs are 
conceptualized at the theoretical plane, while variables are operationalized and measured at 
the empirical (observational) plane.  Furthermore, variable s may be independent, dependent, 
mediating, or moderating, as discussed in Chapter 2.  The distinction between constructs 
(conceptualized at the theoretical level) and variables (measured at the empir ical level) is 
shown in Figure 4 .1. 
 
Figure 4 .1.  Disti nction between theoretical and empirical concepts  
 
 Propositions  are associations postulated between constructs based on deductive logic.  
Propositions are stated in declarative form and should ideally indicate a cause -effect 
relationship (e.g., if X occurs, then Y will follow).  Note that propositions may be conjectur al but 
MUST be testable, and should be rejected if they are not supported by empirical observations.  
However, like constructs, propositions are stated at the theoretical level, and they can only be 
tested by examining the corresponding relationship betwee n measurable variables of those 
constructs.  The empirical formulation of propositions, stated as relationships between 
variables, is called hypotheses .  The distinction between propositions (formulated at the 
theoretical level) and hypotheses (tested at t he empirica l level) is depicted in Figure 4 .1. 
The third building block of a theory is the logic  that provides the basis for justifying the 
propositions as postulated.  Logic acts like a “glue” that connects the theoretical constructs and 
provides meaning and relevance to the relationships between these constructs.  Logic also 
represents the “explanation” that lies at the core of a theory.  Without logic, propositions will be 
ad hoc, arbitrary, and meaningless, and cannot be tied into a cohesive “system of propositions” 
that is the heart of any theory.   
Finally, all theories are constrained by assumptions  about values, time, and space, and 
boundary conditions  that govern where the theory can be applied and where it cannot be 
applied.  For example, many econ omic theories assume that human beings are rational (or 

28 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 boundedly rational) and employ utility maximization based on cost and benefit expectations as 
a way of understand human behavior.  In contrast, political science theories assume that people 
are more p olitical than rational, and try to position themselves in their professional or personal 
environment in a way that maximizes their power and control over others.  Given the nature of 
their underlying assumptions, economic and political theories are not dir ectly comparable, and 
researchers should not use economic theories if their objective is to understand the power 
structure or its evolution in a organization.  Likewise, theories may have implicit cultural 
assumptions (e.g., whether they apply to individua listic or collective cultures), temporal 
assumptions (e.g., whether they apply to early stages or later stages of human behavior), and 
spatial assumptions (e.g., whether they apply to certain localities but not to others).  If a theory 
is to be properly us ed or tested, all of its implicit assumptions that form the boundaries of that 
theory must be properly understood.  Unfortunately, theorists rarely state their implicit 
assumptions clearly, which leads to frequent misapplications of theories to problem sit uations 
in research.  
Attributes of a Good Theory  
Theories are simplified and often partial explanations of complex social reality.  As such, 
there can be good explanations or poor explanations, and consequently, there can be good 
theories or poor theories.   How can we evaluate the “goodness” of a given theory?  Different 
criteria have been proposed by different researchers, the more important of which are listed 
below:  
 Logical consistency:   Are the theoretical constructs, propositions, boundary conditions, 
and assumptions logically consistent with each other?  If some of these “building blocks” 
of a theory are inconsistent with each other (e.g., a theory assumes rationality, but some 
constructs represent non -rational concepts), then the theory is a poor theo ry. 
 Explanatory power:   How much does a given theory explain (or predict) reality?  Good 
theories obviously explain the target phenomenon better than rival theories, as often 
measured by variance explained (R -square) value in regression equations.  
 Falsifia bility:   British philosopher Karl Popper stated in the 1940’s that for theories to 
be valid, they must be falsifiable.  Falsifiability ensures that the theory is potentially 
disprovable, if empirical data does not match with theoretical propositions, which  
allows for their empirical testing by researchers.  In other words, theories cannot be 
theories unless they can be empirically testable.  Tautological statements, such as “a day 
with high temperatures is a hot day” are not empirically testable because a h ot day is 
defined (and measured) as a day with high temperatures, and hence, such statements 
cannot be viewed as a theoretical proposition.  Falsifiability requires presence of rival 
explanations it ensures that the constructs are adequately measurable, an d so forth.  
However, note that saying that a theory is falsifiable is not the same as saying that a 
theory should be falsified.  If a theory is indeed falsified based on empirical evidence, 
then it was probably a poor theory to begin with!  
 Parsimony:   Parsimony examines how much of a phenomenon is explained with how 
few variables.  The concept is attributed to 14th century English logician Father William 
of Ockham (and hence called “Ockham’s razor” or “Occam’s razor), which states that 
among competing exp lanations that sufficiently explain the observed evidence, the 
simplest theory (i.e., one that uses the smallest number of variables or makes the fewest 
T h e o r i e s  i n  S c i e n t i f i c  R e s e a r c h  | 29 
 
 
 assumptions) is the best.  Explanation of a complex social phenomenon can always be 
increased by adding  more and more constructs.  However, such approach defeats the 
purpose of having a theory, which are intended to be “simplified” and generalizable 
explanations of reality.  Parsimony relates to the degrees of freedom in a given theory.  
Parsimonious theori es have higher degrees of freedom, which allow them to be more 
easily generalized to other contexts, settings, and populations.  
Approaches to Theorizing  
 How do researchers build theories?  Steinfeld and Fulk (1990)2 recommend four such 
approaches.  The first approach is to build theories inductively based on observed patterns of 
events or behaviors.  Such approach is often called “grounded theory building”, because the 
theory is grounded in empirical observations.  T his technique is heavily dependent on the 
observational and interpretive abilities of the  researcher, and the resulting theory may be 
subjective and non -confirmable .  Furthermore, observing certain patterns of events will not 
necessarily make a theory, unl ess the researcher is able to provide consistent explanations for 
the observed patterns.  We will discuss the grounded theory approach in a later chapter on 
qualitative research.  
 The second approach to theory building is to conduct a bottom -up conceptual analysis 
to identify different sets of predictors relevant to the phenomenon of interest using a 
predefined framework.  One such framework may be a simple input -process -output framework, 
where the researcher may look for different categories of inputs, suc h as individual, 
organizational, and/or technological factors potentially related to the phenomenon of interest 
(the output), and describe the underlying processes that link these factors to the target 
phenomenon.  This is also an inductive approach that relies heavily on the inductive abilities of 
the researcher , and interpretation  may be b iased  by researcher’s prior knowledge of the 
phenomenon being studied . 
 The third approach to theorizing is to extend or modify existing theories to explain a 
new contex t, such as by extending theories of individual learning to explain organizational 
learning.  While making such an extension, certain concepts, propositions, and/or boundary 
conditions of the old theory may be retained and others modified to fit the new con text.  This 
deductive approach leverages the rich inventory of social science theories developed by prior 
theoreticians, and is an efficient way of building new theories by building on existing ones.   
 The fourth approach is to apply existing theories in entirely new contexts by drawing 
upon the structural similarities between the two contexts.  This approach relies on reasoning by 
analogy, and is probably the most creative way of theorizing using a deductive approach.  For 
instance, Markus (1987)3 used an alogic similarities between a nuclear explosion and 
uncontrolled growth of networks or network -based businesses to propose a critical mass 
theory of network growth.  Just as a nuclear explosion requires a critical mass of radioactive 
material to sustain a nuclear explosion, Markus suggested that a network requires a  critical 
mass of users to sustain its growth, and without such critical mass, users may leave the 
network, causing an eventual demise of the network.

 Examples of Social Science Theories  
 In this  section, we present brief overviews of a few illustrative theories from different 
social science disciplines.  These theories explain different types of social behaviors, using a set 
of constructs, propositions, boundary conditions, assumptions, and under lying logic.  Note that 
the following represents just a simplistic introduction to these theories; readers are advised to 
consult the original sources of these theories for more details and insights on each theory.  
 Agency Theory.   Agency theory (also called principal -agent theory), a classic theory in 
the organizational economics literature, was originally proposed by Ross (1973)4 to explain 
two-party relationships (such as those between an employer and its employees, between 
organ izational executives and shareholders, and between buyers and sellers) whose goals are 
not congruent with each other.  The goal of agency theory is to specify optimal contracts and the 
conditions under which such contracts may help minimize the effect of g oal incongruence.  The 
core assumptions of this theory are that human beings are self -interested individuals, 
boundedly rational, and risk -averse, and the theory can be applied at the individual or 
organizational level.  
 The two parties in this theory are the principal and the agent; the principal employs the 
agent to perform certain tasks on its behalf.  While the principal’s goal is quick and effective 
completion of the assigned task, the agent’s goal may be working at its own pace, avoiding risks, 
and se eking self -interest (such as personal pay) over corporate interests.  Hence, the goal 
incongruence.  Compounding the nature of the problem may be information asymmetry 
problems caused by the principal’s inability to adequately observe the agent’s behavior or 
accurately evaluate the agent’s skill sets.  Such asymmetry may lead to agency problems where 
the agent may not put forth the effort needed to get the task done (the moral hazard  problem) 
or may misrepresent its expertise or skills to get the job but no t perform as expected (the 
adverse selection problem).  Typical contracts that are behavior -based, such as a monthly salary, 
cannot overcome these problems.  Hence, agency theory recommends using outcome -based 
contracts, such as a commissions or a fee paya ble upon task completion, or mixed contracts that 
combine behavior -based and outcome -based incentives.  An employee stock option plans are is 
an example of an outcome -based contract while employee pay is a behavior -based contract.  
Agency theory also recom mends tools that principals may employ to improve the efficacy of 
behavior -based contracts, such as investing in monitoring mechanisms (such as hiring 
supervisors) to counter the information asymmetry caused by moral hazard, designing 
renewable contracts c ontingent on agent’s performance (performance assessment makes the 
contract partially outcome -based), or by improving the structure of the assigned task to make it 
more programmable and therefore more observable.   
  Theory of Planned Behavior.   Postulated  by Azjen (1991)5, the theory of planned 
behavior ( TPB) is a generalized theory of human behavior in the social psychology literature 
that can be used to study a wide range of individual behaviors.  It presumes that individual 
behavior represents conscious  reasoned choice, and is shaped by cognitive thinking and social 
pressures.  The theory postulates that behaviors are based on one’s intention regarding that 
behavior, which in turn is a function of the person’s attitude toward the behavior, subjective

 norm regarding that behavior, and perception of control over that behavior (see Figure 4.2).  
Attitude is defined as the individual's overall positive or negative feelings about performing the 
behavior in question, which may be assessed as a summation of one' s beliefs regarding the 
different consequences of that behavior, weighted by the desirability of those consequences.  
Subjective norm refers to one’s perception of whether people important to that person expect 
the person to perform the intended behavior, and represented as a weighted combination of the 
expected norms of different referent groups such as friends, colleagues, or supervisors at work.  
Behavioral control is one's perception of internal or external controls constraining the behavior 
in question .  Internal controls may include the person’s ability to perform the intended behavior 
(self -efficacy), while external control refers to the availability of external resources needed to 
perform that behavior (facilitating conditions).  TPB also suggests th at sometimes people may 
intend to perform a given behavior but lack the resources needed to do so, and therefore 
suggests that posits that behavioral control can have a direct effect on behavior, in addition to 
the indirect effect mediated by intention.   
TPB is an extension of an earlier theory called the theory of reasoned action, which 
included attitude and subjective norm as key drivers of intention, but not behavioral control.  
The latter construct was added by Ajzen in TPB to account for circumstances  when people may 
have incomplete control over their own behaviors (such as not having high -speed Internet 
access for web surfing).

 Innovation diffusion theory.   Innovation diffusion theory (IDT) is a seminal theory in 
the communications literature that explains how innovations are adopted within a population 
of potential adopters.  The concept was first studied by French sociologist Gabriel Tarde, but the 
theory was  developed by Everett Rogers in 1962  based on  observations of 508 diffusion 
studies.  The four key elements in this theory are: innovation, communication channels, time, 
and social system.  Innovations may include new technologies, new practices, or new ideas, and 
adopters may be individuals or organ izations.  At the macro (population) level, IDT views 
innovation diffusion as a process of communication where people in a social system learn about 
a new innovation and its potential benefits through communication channels (such as mass 
media or prior ado pters) and are persuaded to adopt it.  Diffusion is a temporal process; the 
diffusion process starts off slow among a few early adopters, then picks up speed as the 
innovation is adopted by the mainstream population, and finally slows down as the adopter 
population reaches saturation.  The cumulative adoption pattern therefore an S -shaped curve, 
as shown in Figure 4.3, and the adopter distribution represents a normal distribution.  All 
adopters are not identical, and adopters can be classified into innovato rs, early adopters, early 
majority, late majority, and laggards based on their time of their adoption.  The rate of diffusion 

32 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 also depends on characteristics of the social system such as the presence of opinion leaders 
(experts whose opinions are valued by  others) and change agents (people who influence others’ 
behaviors).  
At the micro (adopter) level, Rogers (1995)6 suggests that innovation adoption is a 
process consisting of five stages: (1) knowledge: when adopters first  learn about an innovation 
from ma ss-media or interpersonal channels, (2) persuasion: when they are persuaded by prior 
adopters  to try the innovation , (3) decision: their decision to accept or reject the innovation, (4) 
implementation: their initial utilization  of the innovation, and (5) c onfirmation: their decision 
to continue using it to its  fullest potential (see Figure 4 .4).  Five innovation characteristics are 
presumed to shape adopters’ innovation adoption decisions: (1) relative advantage: the 
expected benefits of an innovation relat ive to prior innovations, (2) compatibility: the extent to 
which the innovation fits with the adopter’s work habits, beliefs, and values, (3) complexity: the 
extent to which the innovation is difficult to learn and use, (4) trialability: the extent to whic h 
the innovation can be tested on a trial basis, and (5) observability: the extent to which the 
results of using the innovation can be clearly observed.  The last two characteristics have since 
been dropped from many innovation studies.  Complexity is nega tively correlated to innovation 
adoption, while the other four factors are positively correlated.  Innovation adoption also 
depends on personal factors such as the adopter’s risk -taking propensity, education level, 
cosmopolitanism, and communication influe nce.  Early adopters are venturesome, well 
educated, and rely more on mass media for information about the innovation, while later 
adopters rely more on interpersonal sources (such as friends and family) as their primary 
source of information.  IDT has bee n criticized for having a “pro -innovation bias,” that is for 
presuming that all innovations are beneficial and will be eventually diffused across the entire 
population, and because it does not allow for inefficient innovations such as fads or fashions to 
die off quickly without being adopted by the entire population or being replaced by better 
innovations.

Elaboration Likelihood Model .  Developed by Petty and Cacioppo (1986)7, the 
elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is a dual -process theory of attitude formation or change in 
the psychology literature.  It explains how individuals can be influenced to change their attitude 
toward a certain object, events, or behavior and the re lative efficacy of such change strategies.  
The ELM posits that one’s attitude may be shaped by two “routes” of influence, the central route 
and the peripheral route, which differ in the amount of thoughtful information processing or 
“elaboration” required  of people (see Figure 4 .5).  The central route requires a person to think 
about issue -related arguments in an informational message and carefully scrutinize the merits 
and relevance of those arguments, before forming an informed judgment about the target 
object.  In the peripher al route, subjects rely on external “cues” such as number of prior users, 
endorsements from experts, or likeability of the endorser, rather than on the quality of 
arguments, in framing their attitude towards the target object.  The latter route is less 
cognitively demanding, and the routes of attitude change are typically operationalized in the 
ELM using the argument quality  and peripheral cues  constructs respectively.  
 
Figure 4.5.  Elaboration likelihood model   
 
Whether people will be influenced by the cen tral or peripheral routes depends upon 
their ability and motivation to elaborate the central merits of an argument.  This ability and 
motivation to elaborate is called elaboration likelihood .  People in a state of high elaboration 
likelihood (high ability and high motivation) are more likely to thoughtfully process the 
information presented and are therefore more influenced by argument quality, while those in 
the low elaboration likelihood state are more motivated by peripheral cues.  Elaboration 
likelihood  is a situational characteristic and not a personal trait.  For instance, a doctor may 
employ the central route for diagnosing and treating a medical ailment (by virtue of his or her 
expertise of the subject), but may rely on peripheral cues from auto mech anics to understand

 the problems with his car.  As such, the theory has widespread implications about how to enact 
attitude change toward new products or ideas and even social change.  
 General Deterrence Theory.   Two  utilitarian  philosophers of the eightee nth century,  Cesare 
Beccaria  and Jeremy Bentham, formulated General Deterrence Theory (GDT) as both an explanation 
of crime and a method for reducing it.   GDT examines why certain individuals engage in deviant, 
anti -social, or criminal behaviors.  This the ory holds that people are fundamentally rational (for 
both conforming and deviant behaviors), and that they freely choose deviant behaviors based 
on a rational cost -benefit calculation.  Because people naturally choose utility -maximizing 
behaviors, deviant  choices that engender personal gain or pleasure can be controlled by 
increasing the costs of such behaviors in the form of punishments (countermeasures) as well as 
increasing the probability of apprehension.  Swiftness, severity, and certainty of punishme nts 
are the key constructs in GDT.   
While classical positivist research in criminology seeks generalized causes of criminal 
behaviors, such as poverty, lack of education, psychological conditions, and recommends 
strategies to rehabilitate criminals, such as by providing them job training and medical 
treatment, GDT focuses on the criminal decision making process and situational factors that 
influence that process.  Hence, a criminal’s personal situation (such as his personal values, his 
affluence, and his n eed for money) and the environmental context (such as how protected is the 
target, how efficient is the local police, how likely are criminals to be apprehended) play key 
roles in this decision making process.  The focus of GDT is not how to rehabilitate c riminals and 
avert future criminal behaviors, but how to make criminal activities less attractive and 
therefore prevent crimes.  To that end, “target hardening” such as installing deadbolts and 
building self -defense skills, legal deterrents such as elimina ting parole for certain crimes, “three 
strikes law” (mandatory incarceration for three offenses, even if the offenses are minor and not 
worth imprisonment), and the death penalty, increasing the chances of apprehension using 
means such as neighborhood watc h programs, special task forces on drugs or gang -related 
crimes, and increased police patrols, and educational programs such as highly visible notices 
such as “Trespassers will be prosecuted” are effective in preventing crimes.  This theory has 
interesting  implications not only for traditional crimes, but also for contemporary white -collar 
crimes such as insider trading, software piracy, and illegal sharing of music.

Research Design  
 
  
Research design is a comprehensive plan for data collection in an empirical research 
project .  It is a “blueprint” for empirical research aimed at answering specific research 
questions or testing specific hypotheses , and must specify at least three processes: (1) the data 
collection process, (2) the instrument development process, and (3) the sampling process.  The 
instrument development and sampling processes are described in next two chapters, and the 
data collecti on process (which is often loosely called “research design”) is introduced in this 
chapter and is described in further detail  in Chapters 9 -12. 
 Broadly speaking, data collection methods can be broadly grouped into two categories: 
positivist and interpreti ve.  Positivist methods , such as laboratory experiments and survey 
research, are aimed at theory (or hypotheses) testing, while interpretive  methods, such as 
action research and ethnography,  are aimed at theory building.  Positivist methods employ a 
deductive approach to research, starting  with a theory and test ing theoretical postulates using 
empirical data.  In contrast, interpretive methods  employ an inductive approach that starts 
with data and tries to derive a theory about the phenomenon of inte rest from the observed 
data.  Often times, these methods are incorrectly equated with quantit ative and qualitative 
research.  Q uantitative and qualitative methods refers to the type of data being collected 
(quantitative data involve numeric scores, metrics , and so on, while qualitative  data includes 
interview s, observations , and so forth ) and anal yzed (i.e., using quantitative techniques such as 
regression  or qualitative techniques  such as coding ).  Positivist research uses predominantly 
quantitative data, but can also use qualitative data.  Interpretive research relies heavily on 
qualitative data, but can sometimes benefit from including quantitative data as well.  
Sometimes, joint use of qualitative  and quantitative data may help generate unique insight into 
a complex social phenomenon  that are not available from either types of data alone , and h ence, 
mixed -mode designs  that combine  qualitative and quantitative data are often highly desirable.  
Key At tributes of a Research Design  
 The quality of research designs can be defined  in terms of four key design attributes: 
internal validity, external validity, construct validity, and statistical conclusion validity.  
 Internal validity , also called causality, examines whether the observed change in a 
dependent variable is indeed caused by a corresponding change in hypothesized independent 
variable, and not by variables extraneous to the research context.  Causality requires three 
condit ions: (1) covariation of cause and effect (i.e., if cause happens, then effect also happens; 
and if cause does not happen, effect does not happen), (2) temporal precedence: cause must 
36 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 precede effect in time, (3) no plausible alternative explanation (or spu rious correlation).  
Certain research designs, such as laboratory experiments, are strong in internal validity by 
virtue of their ability to manipulate the independent variable (cause) via a treatment and 
observe the effect (dependent variable) of that tre atment after a certain point in time, while 
controlling for the effects of extraneous variables.  Other designs, such as field surveys, are poor 
in internal validity because of their inability to manipulate the independent variable (cause), 
and because cau se and effect are measured at the same point in time which defeats temporal 
precedence making it equally likely that the expected effect might have influenced the expected 
cause rather than the reverse.  Although higher in internal validity compared to oth er methods, 
laboratory experiments are, by no means, immune to threats of internal validity, and are 
susceptible to history, testing, instrumentation, regression, and other threats that are discussed 
later in the chapter on experimental designs.  Nonethele ss, different research designs vary 
considerably in their respective level of internal validity.  
 External validity  or generalizability refers to whether the observed associations can be 
generalized from the sample to the population (population validity ), or to other people, 
organizations, contexts, or time (ecological validity).  For instance, can results drawn from a 
sample of financial firms in the United States be generalized to the population of financial firms 
(population validity) or to other firms w ithin the United States (ecological validity)?   Survey 
research, where data is sourced from a wide variety of individuals, firms, or other units of 
analysis, tends to have broader generalizability than laboratory experiments where artificially 
contrived t reatments and strong control over extraneous variables render the findings less 
generalizable to real -life settings where treatments and extraneous variables cannot be 
controlled.  The variation in internal and external validity for a wide range of researc h designs 
are shown in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1.   Internal and external validity  
Some researchers claim that there is a tradeoff between internal and external validity: 
higher external validity can come only at the cost of in ternal validity and vice -versa.  But this is 
not always the case.  Research designs such as field experiments, longitudinal field surveys, and 
multiple case studies have higher degrees of both internal and external validities.  P ersonal ly, I 
prefer researc h designs that have reasonable degrees of both internal and external validities, 
i.e., those that fall within the cone of validity shown in Figure 5.1.  But this should not suggest 
that designs outside this cone are any less useful or valuable.  Researcher s’ choice of designs is 
R e s e a r c h  D e s i g n  | 37 
 
 
 ultimately a matter of their personal preference and competence, and the level of internal and 
external validity  they desire . 
 Construct validity  examines how well a given measurement scale is measuring the 
theoretical construct that it is expected to measure.  Many constructs used in social science 
research such as empathy, resistance to change, and organizational learning are difficult to 
define,  much less measure.  For instance, construct validity must assure that a measure of 
empathy is indeed measuring empathy and not compassion, which may be difficult since these 
constructs are somewhat similar in meaning.  Construct validity is assessed in positivist  
research based on correlational or factor analysis of pilot test data, as described in the next 
chapter.  
Statistical conclusion validity  examines the extent to which conclusions derived using 
a statistical procedure is valid.  For example, it exam ines whether the right statistical method 
was used for hypotheses testing, whether the variables used meet the assumptions of that 
statistical test (such as sample size or distributional requirements), and so forth.  Because 
interpretive  research designs d o not employ statistical test, statistical conclusion validity is not 
applicable for such analysis.  The different kinds of validity and where they exist at the 
theoretical/empirical levels are illustrated in Figure 5.2.  
 
Figure 5.2.  Different Types of Validity in Scientific Research  
Improving Internal and External Validity  
The best research designs are those that can assure high levels of internal and external 
validity.  Such designs would guard against spurious correlations, inspire greater faith in th e 
hypotheses testing, and ensure that the results drawn from a small sample are generalizable to 
the population at large.  Controls are required to assure internal validity (causality) of research 
designs, and can be accomplished in four ways: (1) manipula tion, (2) elimination, (3) inclusion, 
and (4) statistical control, and (5) randomization.  
In manipulation , the researcher manipulates the independent variables in one or more 
levels (called “treatments”), and compares the effects of the treatments against a control group 
where subjects do not receive the treatment.  Treatments may include a new drug or different 

38 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 dosage of drug (for treating a medical condition), a, a teaching style (for students), and so forth.  
This type of control is achieved in experimen tal or quasi -experimental designs but not in non -
experimental designs such as surveys.  Note that if subjects cannot distinguish adequately 
between different levels of treatment manipulations, their responses across treatments may not 
be different, and man ipulation would fail.  
The elimination  technique relies on eliminating extraneous variables by holding them 
constant across treatments, such as by restricting the study to a single gender or a single socio -
economic status.  In the inclusion  technique, the r ole of extraneous variables is considered by 
including them in the research design and separately estimating their effects on the dependent 
variable, such as via factorial designs where one factor is gender (male versus female).  Such 
technique allows for greater generalizability but also requires substantially larger samples.  In 
statistical control , extraneous variables are measured and used as covariates during the 
statistical testing process.  
Finally, the randomization  technique is aimed at canceling ou t the effects of extraneous 
variables through a process of random sampling, if it can be assured that these effects are of a 
random (non -systematic) nature.  Two types of randomization are: (1) random selection , 
where a sample is selected randomly from a p opulation, and (2) random assignment , where 
subjects selected in a non -random manner are randomly assigned to treatment groups.   
Randomization also assures external validity, allowing inferences drawn from the 
sample to be generalized to the population fr om which the sample is drawn.  Note that random 
assignment is mandatory when random selection is not possible because of resource or access 
constraints.  However, generalizability across populations is harder to ascertain since 
populations may differ on mu ltiple dimensions and you can only control for few of those 
dimensions.   
Popular Research Designs  
As noted earlier, r esearch designs can be classified into two categories – positivist and 
interpretive – depending how their goal in scientific research.  Po sitivist designs are meant for 
theory testing, while interpretive designs are meant for theory building.  Positivist designs seek 
generalized patterns based on an objective view of reality, while interpretive designs seek 
subjective interpretations of social phenomena from the perspectives of the subjects involved.  
Some p opular examples of positivist designs include laboratory experiments, field experiments, 
field surveys, secondary data analysis, and case research while examples of interpretive designs 
include case research, phenomenology, and ethnography.  Note that case research can be used 
for theory build ing or theory testing, though not at the same time.  Not all techniques are suited 
for all kinds of scientific research.  Some techniques such as focus groups are best suited for 
exploratory research, others such as ethnography are best for descriptive res earch, and still 
others such as laboratory experiments are ideal for explanatory research.  Following are br ief 
descriptions of some of these designs.  Additional details are provided in Chapters  9-12. 
Experimental studies  are those that are intended to te st cause -effect relationships 
(hypotheses) in a tightly controlled setting by separating the cause from the effect in time, 
administering the cause to one group of subjects (the “treatment group”) but not to another 
group (“control group”), and observing h ow the mean effects vary between subjects in these 
two groups.  For instance, if we design a laboratory experiment to test the efficacy of a new drug 
in treating a certain ailment, we can get a random sample of people afflicted with that ailment, 
R e s e a r c h  D e s i g n  | 39 
 
 
 randomly assign them to one of two groups (treatment and control groups), administer the 
drug to subjects in the treatment group, but only give a placebo (e.g., a sugar pill with no 
medicinal value) .  More complex designs may include multiple treatment groups, such  as low 
versus high dosage of the drug, multiple treatments, such as combining drug administration 
with dietary intervention s.  In a true experimental design , subjects must be randomly 
assigned between each group.  If random assignment is not followed, the n the design becomes 
quasi -experimental .  Experiments can be conducted in an artificial or laboratory setting  such 
as at a university  (laboratory experiments) or in field settings such as in an organization where 
the phenomenon of interest is actually occu rring (field experiments).  Laboratory experiments 
allow the researcher to isolate the variables of interest and control for extraneous variables, 
which may not be possible in field experiments.  Hence, inferences drawn from laboratory 
experiments tend to be stronger in internal validity, but those from field experiments tend to be 
stronger in external validity.  Experimental data is analyzed using quantitative statistical 
techniques.  The primary strength of the experimental design is its strong internal validity due 
to its ability to isolate, control, and intensively examine a small number of variables, while its 
primary weakness is limited external generalizability since real life is often more complex (i.e., 
involve more extraneous variables) than contr ived lab settings.  Furthermore, if the research 
does not identify ex ante relevant extraneous variables and control for such variables, such lack 
of controls may hurt internal validity and may lead to spurious correlations.  
Field surveys  are non -experimen tal designs that do not control for or manipulate  
independent variables or treatments , but measure these variables and test their effects using 
statistical methods .  Field surveys capture snapshots of practices, beliefs, or situations from a 
random sample of subjects in field settings through a survey questionnaire or less frequently, 
through a structured interview.  In cross -sectional field surveys , independent and dependent 
variables are measured at the same point in time (e.g., using a single questionnai re), while in 
longitudinal field surveys , dependent variables are measured at a later point in time  than the 
independent variables .  The strength s of field surveys are their external validity (since data is 
collected in field settings), their ability to ca pture and control for a large number of variables, 
and their ability to study a problem from multiple perspectives or using multiple theories.  
However, because of their non -temporal nature, internal validity (cause -effect relationships) 
are difficult to i nfer, and surveys may be subject to respondent biases (e.g., subjects may 
provide a “socially desirable” response rather than their true  response ) which further hurts 
internal validity.  
Secondary data analysis  is an analysis of data that has previously been collected and 
tabulated by other sources.  Such data may include data from government agencies such as 
employment statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Services or development statistics by 
country from the United Nations Development Program, data col lected by other researchers 
(often used in meta -analytic studie s), or publicly available third -party data, such as financial 
data from stock markets or real -time auction data from eBay.   This is in contrast to most other 
research designs where collecting primary data for research is part of the researcher’s job.  
Secondary data analysis may be an effective means of research where primary data collection is 
too costly or infeasible, and secondary data is available at a level of analysis suitable for 
answeri ng the researcher’s questions.   The limitations of this design are that the data might not 
have been collected in a systematic or scientific manner and hence unsu itable for scientific 
research, since the data was collected for a presumably different purpo se, they may not 
adequately address the research questions of interest to the researcher , and interval validity is 
problematic if the temporal precedence between cause and effect is unclear .

 Case research  is an in-depth investigation of a problem in one or  more real -life settings 
(case sites) over an extended period of time.  Data may be collected using a combination of 
interviews, personal observations, and internal or external documents.  Case studies can be 
positivist in nature (for hypotheses testing) o r interpretive (for theory building).  The strength 
of this research method is its ability to discover a wide variety of social, cultural, and political 
factors potentially related to the phenomenon of interest  that may not be known in advance.  
Analysis t ends to be qualitative in nature, but heavily contextualized and nuanced .  However, 
interpretation of findings may depend on the observational and integrative ability of the 
researcher, lack of control may make it difficult to establish causality , and find ings from a single 
case site may not be readily generalized to other case sites .  Generalizability can be improved by 
replicating and comparing the analysis in other case sites in a multiple case design . 
Focus group research  is a type of research that invo lves bringing in a small group of 
subjects (typically 6 to 10 people) at one location, and having them discuss a phenomenon of 
interest for a period of 1.5 to 2 hours.  The discussion is moderated and led by a trained 
facilitator, who sets the agenda and poses an initial set of questions for participants, makes sure 
that ideas and experiences of all participants are represented, and attempts to build a holistic 
understanding of the problem situation based on participants’ comments and experiences.  
Interna l validity cannot be established due to lack of controls and the findings may not be 
generalized to other settings because of small sample size.  Hence, focus groups are not 
generally used for explanatory or descriptive research, but are more suited for ex ploratory 
research.  
Action research  assumes that complex social phenomena are best understood by 
introducing interventions or “actions” into those phenomena and observing the effects of those 
actions.  In this method, the researcher is usually a consultant  or an organizational member 
embedded within a social context such as an organization, who initiates an action such as new 
organizational procedures or new technologies, in response to a real problem such as declining 
profitability or operational bottlenec ks.  The researcher’s choice of actions must be based on 
theory, which should explain why and how such actions may cause the desired change.  The 
researcher then observes the results of that action, modifying it as necessary, while 
simultaneously learning from the action and generating theoretical insights about the target 
problem and interventions.  The initial theory is validated by the extent to which the chosen 
action successfully solves the target problem.  Simultaneous problem solving and insight 
gene ration is the central feature that distinguishes action research from all other research 
methods, and hence, action research is an excellent method for bridging research and practice.  
This method is also suited for studying unique social problems that can not be replicated outside 
that context, but it is also subject to researcher bias and subjectivity, and the generalizability of 
findings is often restricted to the context where the study was conducted.  
Ethnography  is a n interpretive  research design inspir ed by anthropology that 
emphasizes that research phenomenon must be studied within the context of its culture.  The 
researcher is deeply immersed in a certain culture over an extended period of time (8 months 
to 2 years), and during that period, engages, o bserves, and records the daily life of the studied 
culture, and theorizes about the evolution and behaviors in that culture.  Data is collected 
primarily via observation al techniques , formal and informal interaction with participants in 
that culture, and p ersonal field notes , while data analysis involves “sense -making ”.  The 
researcher must narrate her experience in great detail so that readers may experience that 
same culture without necessarily being there.  The advantage s of this approach are its 
sensiti veness to the context, the rich and nuanced understanding it generates, and minimal 
R e s e a r c h  D e s i g n  | 41 
 
 
 respondent bias.  However, this is also an extremely time and resource -intensive approach, and 
findings are specific to a given culture and less generalizable to other cult ures.  
Selecting Research Designs  
Given the above multitude of research designs, which design should researchers choose 
for their research?  Generally speaking, researchers tend to select those research designs that 
they are most comfortable with and feel m ost competent to handle, but ideally, the choice 
should depend on the nature of the research phenomenon being studied.  In the preliminary 
phases of research, whe n the research problem is unclear and  the researcher wants to scope 
out the nature and extent of a certain research problem, a focus group (for individual unit of 
analysis) or a case study (for organizational unit of analysis) is an ideal strategy for exploratory 
research.  As one delves furt her into the research domain, but finds that there are no good 
theories to explain the phenomenon of interest and wants to build a theory to fill in the unmet 
gap in that area, interpretive designs such as case research  or ethnography may be useful 
designs .  If competing theories exist and the researcher wishes to test these different theories  or 
integrate them into a larger theory, positivist designs such as experimental design , survey 
research , or secondary data analysis  are more appropriate . 
Regardless o f the specific research design chosen, the researcher should strive to collect 
quantitative and qualitative data using a combination of techniques such as questionnaires, 
interviews, observations, documents , or secondary data .  For instance, even in a high ly 
structured survey questionnaire, intended to collect quantitative data, the researcher may leave 
some room for a few open -ended questions to collect qualitative data that may generate 
unexpected insights not otherwise available from structured quantitat ive data alone.  Likewise, 
while case research employ mostly face -to-face interviews to collect most qualitative data, the 
potential and value of collecting quantitative data should not be ignored.  As an example, in a 
study of organizational decision maki ng processes, the case interviewer can record numeric 
quantities such as how many months it took to make certain organizational decisions, how 
many people were involved in that decision process, and how many decision alternatives were 
considered, which can  provide valuable insights not otherwise available from interviewees’ 
narrative responses.  Irrespective of the specific research design employed, the goal of the 
researcher should be to collect as much and as diverse data as possible that can help generat e 
the best possible insights about the phenomenon of interest.

Measurement of Constructs  
 
 
 Theoretical propositions consist of relationships between abstract constructs.  Testing 
theories (i.e., theoretical propositions) require measuring these constructs accurately, correctly, 
and in a scientific manner, before the strength of their relationshi ps can be tested.  
Measurement refers to careful, deliberate observations of the real world and is the essence of 
empirical research.  While some constructs in social science research, such as a person’s age, 
weight, or a firm’s size, may be easy to measur e, other constructs, such as creativity, prejudice, 
or alienation, may be considerably harder to measure.  In this chapter, we will examine the 
related processes of conceptualization and operationalization for creating measures of such 
constructs.   
Concep tualization  
 Conceptualization  is the mental process by which fuzzy and imprecise constructs 
(concepts) and their constituent components are defined in concrete and precise terms.  For 
instance, we often use the word “prejudice” and the word conjures a cer tain image in our mind; 
however, we may struggle if we were asked to define exactly what the term meant.  If someone 
says bad things about other racial groups, is that racial prejudice?  If women earn less than men 
for the same job, is that gender prejudic e?  If churchgoers believe that non -believers will burn 
in hell, is that religious prejudice?  Are there different kinds of prejudice, and if so, what are 
they?  Are there different levels of prejudice, such as high or low?  Answering all of these 
question s is the key to measuring the prejudice construct correctly.  The process of 
understanding what is included and what is excluded in the concept of prejudice is the 
conceptualization process.  
 The conceptualization process is all the more important because of the imprecision, 
vagueness, and ambiguity of many social science constructs.  For instance, is “compassion” the 
same thing as “empathy” or “sentimentality”?  If you have a proposition stating that 
“compassion is positively related to empathy”, you canno t test that proposition unless you can 
conceptually separate empathy from compassion and then empirically measure these two very 
similar constructs correctly.  If deeply religious people believe that some members of their 
society, such as nonbelievers, gay s, and abortion doctors, will burn in hell for their sins, and 
forcefully try to change the “sinners” behaviors to prevent them from going to hell, are they 
acting in a prejudicial manner or a compassionate manner?  Our definition of such constructs is 
not based on any objective criterion, but rather on a shared (“inter -subjective”) agreement 
between our mental images (conceptions) of these constructs.   
44 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
  While defining constructs such as prejudice or compassion, we must understand that 
sometimes, these con structs are not real or can exist independently, but are simply imaginary 
creations in our mind.  For instance, there may be certain tribes in the world who lack prejudice 
and who cannot even imagine what this concept entails.  But in real life, we tend to  treat this 
concept as real.  The process of regarding mental constructs as real is called reification , which is 
central to defining constructs and identifying measurable variables for measuring them.   
One important decision in conceptualizing constructs is specifying whether they are 
unidimensional and multidimensional.  Unidimensional  constructs are those that are expected 
to have a single underlying dimension.  These constructs can be measured using a single 
measure or test.  Examples include simple con structs such as a person’s weight, wind speed, 
and probably even complex constructs like self -esteem (if we conceptualize self -esteem as 
consisting of a single dimension, which of course, may be a unrealistic assumption).  
Multidimensional  constructs consist of two or more underlying dimensions.  For instance, if 
we conceptualize a person’s academic aptitude as consisting of two dimensions – mathematical 
and verbal ability – then academic aptitude is a multidimensional construct.  Each of t he 
underlying dimensions in this case must be measured separately, say, using different tests for 
mathematical and verbal ability, and the two scores can be combined, possibly in a weighted 
manner, to create an overall value for the academic aptitude const ruct.   
Operationalization  
Once a theoretical construct is defined, exactly how do we measure it?  
Operationalization  refers to the process of developing indicators  or items for measuring 
these constructs.  For instance, if an unobservable theoretical cons truct such as socioeconomic 
status is defined as the level of family income, it can be operationalized using an indicator that 
asks respondents the question: what is your annual family income?  Given the high level of 
subjectivity and imprecision inherent in social science constructs, we tend to measure most of 
those constructs (except a few demographic constructs such as age, gender, education, and 
income) using multiple indicators.  This process allows us to examine the closeness amongst 
these indicators as an assessment of their accuracy (reliability).   
Indicators operate at the empirical level, in contrast to constructs, which are 
conceptualized at the theoretical level.  The combination of indicators at the empirical level 
representing a given construc t is called a variable .  As noted in a previous chapter, variables 
may be independent, dependent, mediating, or moderating, depending on how they are 
employed in a research study.  Also each indicator may have several attributes  (or levels) and 
each attrib ute represent a value .  For instance, a “gender” variable may have two attributes: 
male or female.  Likewise, a customer satisfaction scale may be constructed to represent five 
attributes: “strongly dissatisfied”, “somewhat dissatisfied”, “neutral”, “somew hat satisfied” and 
“strongly satisfied”.  Values of attributes may be quantitative  (numeric) or qualitative  (non -
numeric).  Quantitative data can be analyzed using quantitative data analysis techniques, such 
as regression or structural equation modeling, w hile qualitative data require qualitative data 
analysis techniques, such as coding.  Note that many variables in social science research are 
qualitative, even when represented in a quantitative manner.  For instance, we can create a 
customer satisfaction i ndicator with five attributes: strongly dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, 
neutral, somewhat satisfied, and strongly satisfied, and assign numbers 1 through 5 
respectively for these five attributes, so that we can use sophisticated statistical tools for 
quantitative data analysis.  However, note that the numbers are only labels associated with 
M e a s u r e m e n t  o f  C o n s t r u c t s  | 45 
 
 
 respondents’ personal evaluation of their own satisfaction, and the underlying variable 
(satisfaction) is still qualitative even though we represented it in a quant itative manner.  
Indicators may be reflective or formative.  A reflective indicator  is a measure that 
“reflects” an underlying construct.  For example, if religiosity is defined as a construct that 
measures how religious a person is, then attending religiou s services may be a reflective 
indicator of religiosity.  A formative indicator  is a measure that “forms” or contributes to an 
underlying construct.  Such indicators may represent different dimensions of the construct of 
interest.  For instance, if religio sity is defined as composing of a belief dimension, a devotional 
dimension, and a ritual dimension, then indicators chosen to measure each of these different 
dimensions will be considered formative indicators.  Unidimensional constructs are measured 
using reflective indicators (even though multiple reflective indicators may be used for 
measuring abstruse constructs such as self -esteem), while multidimensional constructs are 
measured as a formative combination of the multiple dimensions, even though each of the 
underlying dimensions may be measured using one or more reflective indicators.  
Levels of Measurement  
The first decision to be made in operationalizing a construct is to decide on what is the 
intended level of measurement.  Levels of measurement , also called rating scales , refer to the 
values that an indicator can take (but says nothing about the indicator itself).  For example, 
male and female (or M and F, or 1 and 2) are two levels of the indicator “gender.”  In his seminal 
article  titled "On t he theory of scales of measurement" published in Science  in 1946, 
psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens  (1946) defined four generic types of rating scales for 
scientific measurements: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.  The statistical properties 
of these scales are shown in Table 6.1.  
Scale   Central Tendency  Statistics  Transformations  
Nominal  Mode  Chi-square  One -to-one (equality)  
Ordinal  Median  Percentile, non -parametric 
statistics  Monotonic increasing 
(order)  
Interval  Arithmetic mean, range, 
standard deviation  Correlation, regression, 
analysis of variance  Positive linear (affine)  
Ratio  Geometric mean, 
harmonic mean  Coefficient of variation  Positive similarities 
(multiplicative, logarithmic)  
Note:  All higher -order scales can use any of the statistics for lower order scales.  
 
Table 6.1.  Statistical properties of rating scales  
 
Nominal scales , also called categorical scales,  measure  categorical data.  These scales 
are used for variables or indicators that have mutually exclusive attributes.  Examples include 
gender (two values: male or female), industry type (manufacturing, financial, agriculture, etc.), 
and religious affiliation (Chr istian, Muslim, Jew, etc.).  Even if we assign unique numbers to each 
value, for instance 1 for male and 2 for female, the numbers don’t really mean anything (i.e., 1 is 
not less than or half of 2) and could have been easily been represented non -numericall y, such as 
46 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 M for male and F for female.  Nominal scales merely offer names  or labels  for different attribute 
values.  The appropriate measure of central tendency of a nominal scale is mode, and neither 
the mean nor the median can be defined.  Permissible s tatistics are chi -square and frequency 
distribution, and only a one -to-one (equality) transformation is allowed (e.g., 1=Male, 
2=Female).  
Ordinal scales are those that measure rank -ordered  data, such as the ranking of 
students in a class as first, second, third, and so forth, based on their grade point average or test 
scores.  However, the actual or relative values of attributes or difference in attribute values 
cannot be assessed .  For instance, ranking of students in class says nothing about the actual GP A 
or test scores of the students, or how they well performed relative to one another.  A classic 
example in the natural sciences is  Moh’s scale of mineral hardness, which characterizes the 
hardness of various minerals by their ability to scratch other mine rals.  For instance, diamonds 
can scratch all other naturally occurring minerals on earth, and hence diamond is the “hardest” 
mineral.  However, the scale does not indicate the actual hardness of these minerals or even 
provides a relative assessment of the ir hardness.  Ordinal scales can also use attribute labels 
(anchors) such as “bad”, “medium”, and “good”, or "strongly dissatisfied", "somewhat 
dissatisfied", "neutral", or "somewhat satisfied", and "strongly satisfied”.  In the latter case, we 
can say tha t respondents who are “somewhat satisfied” are less satisfied than those who are 
“strongly satisfied”, but we cannot quantify their satisfaction levels.  The central tendency 
measure of an ordinal scale can be its median or mode, and means are uninterpreta ble.  Hence, 
statistical analyses may involve percentiles and non -parametric analysis, but more 
sophisticated techniques such as correlation, regression, and analysis of variance, are not 
appropriate.  Monotonically increasing transformation (which retains  the ranking) is allowed.  
Interval scales are those where the values measured are not only rank -ordered, but are 
also equidistant from adjacent attributes.  For example, the temperature scale (in Fahrenheit or 
Celsius), where the difference between 30 and  40 degree Fahrenheit is the same as that 
between 80 and 90 degree Fahrenheit.  Likewise, if you have a scale that asks respondents’ 
annual income using the following attributes (ranges): $0 to 10,000, $10,000 to 20,000, $20,000 
to 30,000, and so forth, th is is also an interval scale, because the mid -point of each range (i.e., 
$5,000, $15,000, $25,000, etc.) are equidistant from each other.  The intelligence quotient (IQ) 
scale is also an interval scale, because the scale is designed such that the differenc e between IQ 
scores 100 and 110 is supposed to be the same as between 110 and 120 (although we do not 
really know whether that is truly the case).  Interval scale allows us to examine “how much 
more” is one attribute when compared to another, which is not possible with nominal or ordinal 
scales.  Allowed central tendency measures include mean, median, or mode, as are measures of 
dispersion, such as range and standard deviation.  Permissible statistical analyses include all of 
those allowed for nominal and o rdinal scales, plus correlation, regression, analysis of variance, 
and so on.  Allowed scale transformation are positive linear.  Note that the satisfaction scale 
discussed earlier is not strictly an interval scale, because we cannot say whether the differ ence 
between “strongly satisfied” and “somewhat satisfied” is the same as that between “neutral” and 
“somewhat satisfied” or between “somewhat dissatisfied” and “strongly dissatisfied”.  However, 
social science researchers often “pretend” (incorrectly) tha t these differences are equal so that 
we can use statistical techniques for analyzing ordinal scaled data.  
Ratio scales are those that have all the qualities of nominal, ordinal, and interval scales, 
and in addition, also have a “true zero” point (where th e value zero implies lack or non -
availability of the underlying construct).  Most measurement in the natural sciences and 
engineering, such as mass, incline of a plane, and electric charge, employ ratio scales, as are 
M e a s u r e m e n t  o f  C o n s t r u c t s  | 47 
 
 
 some social science variables such as age, tenure in an organization, and firm size (measured as 
employee count or gross revenues).  For example, a firm of size zero means that it has no 
employees or revenues.  The Kelvin temperature scale is also a ratio scale, in contrast to the 
Fahrenheit o r Celsius scales, because the zero point on this scale (equaling -273.15 degree 
Celsius) is not an arbitrary value but represents a state where the particles of matter at this 
temperature have zero kinetic energy.  These scales are called “ratio” scales be cause the ratios 
of two points on these measures are meaningful and interpretable.  For example, a firm of size 
10 employees is double that of a firm of size 5, and the same can be said for a firm of 10,000 
employees relative to a different firm of 5,000 e mployees.  All measures of central tendencies, 
including geometric and harmonic means, are allowed for ratio scales, as are ratio measures, 
such as studentized range or coefficient of variation.  All statistical methods are allowed.  
Sophisticated transfor mation such as positive similar (e.g., multiplicative or logarithmic) are 
also allowed.  
Based on the four generic types of scales discussed above, we can create specific rating 
scales for social science research.  Common rating scales include binary, Liker t, semantic 
differential, or Guttman scales.  Other less common scales are not discussed here.  
Binary scales.   Binary scales are nominal scales consisting of binary items that assume 
one of two possible values, such as yes or no, true or false, and so on.  For example, a typical 
binary scale for the “political activism” construct may consist of the six binary items shown in 
Table 6.2.  Each item in this scale is a binary item, and the total number of “yes” indicated by a 
respondent (a value from 0 to 6) can  be used as an overall measure of that person’s political 
activism.  To understand how these items were derived, refer to the “Scaling” section later on in 
this chapter.  Binary scales can also employ other values, such as male or female for gender, full -
time or part -time for employment status, and so forth.  If an employment status item is 
modified to allow for more than two possible values (e.g., unemployed, full -time, part -time, and 
retired), it is no longer binary, but still remains a nominal scaled ite m. 
Have you ever written a letter to a public official  Yes No 
Have you ever signed a political petition  Yes No 
Have you ever donated money to a political cause  Yes No 
Have you ever donated money to a candidate running for public office  Yes No 
Have you  ever written a political letter to the editor of a newspaper or magazine  Yes No 
Have you ever persuaded someone to change his/her voting plans  Yes No 
 
Table 6.2.  A six -item binary scale for measuring political activism  
 
Likert scale.   Designed by Rensis Likert, this is a very popular rating scale for 
measuring ordinal data in social science research.  This scale includes Likert items that 
are simply -worded statements to which respondents can indicate their extent of agreement or 
disag reement on a five or seven -point scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly 
agree”.  A typical example of a six -item Likert scale for the “employment self -esteem” construct 
is shown in Table 6.3.  Likert scales are summated scales, that is, the ov erall scale score may be 
a summation of the attribute values of each item as selected by a respondent.  
48 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
  Strongly 
Disagree  Somewhat 
Disagree  Neutral  Somewhat 
Agree  Strongly 
Agree  
I feel good about my job  1 2 3 4 5 
I get along well with others at work  1 2 3 4 5 
I’m proud of my relationship with my 
supervisor at work  1 2 3 4 5 
I can tell that other people at work are 
glad to have me there  1 2 3 4 5 
I can tell that my coworkers respect me  1 2 3 4 5 
I feel like I make a useful contribution 
at work  1 2 3 4 5 
 
Table 6.3.  A six -item Likert scale for measuring employment self -esteem  
 
Likert items allow for more granularity (more finely tuned response) than binary items, 
including whether respondents are neutral to the statement.  Three or nine values (often called 
“anchors”) may also be used, but it is important to use an odd number of values to allow for a 
“neutral” (or “neither agree nor disagree”) anchor.  Some studies have used a “forced choice 
approach” to force respondents to agree or disagree with the LIkert statement by dropping the 
neutral mid -point and using even number of values and, but this is not a good strategy because 
some people may indeed be neutral to a given statement and the forced choice approach does 
not provide them the opportunity to r ecord their neutral stance.  A key characteristic of a Likert 
scale is that even though the statements vary in different items or indicators, the anchors 
(“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”) remain the same.  Likert scales are ordinal scales 
because t he anchors are not necessarily equidistant, even though sometimes we treat them like 
interval scales.

Table 6.4.  A semantic differential scale for measuring attitude toward national health insurance  
 
Semantic differential scale.   This is a composite (multi -item) scale where respondents 
are asked to indicate their opinions or feelings toward a single statement using different pairs 
of adjectives framed as polar opposites.  For instance, the construct “attitude toward national 
heal th insurance” can be measured using four items shown in Table 6.4.  As in the Likert scale, 
the overall scale score may be a summation of individual item scores.  Notice that in Likert 
scales, the statement changes but the anchors remain the same across it ems.  However, in 
semantic differential scales, the statement remains constant, while the anchors (adjective pairs) 
M e a s u r e m e n t  o f  C o n s t r u c t s  | 49 
 
 
 change across items.  Semantic differential is believed to be an excellent technique for 
measuring people’s attitude or feelings toward obje cts, events, or behaviors.   
Guttman scale.   Designed by Louis Guttman, this composite scale uses a series of items 
arranged in increasing order of intensity of the construct of interest, from least intense to most 
intense.  As an example, the construct “a ttitude toward immigrants” can be measured using five 
items shown in Table 6.5.  Each item in the above Guttman scale has a weight (not indicated 
above) which varies with the intensity of that item, and the weighted combination of each 
response is used as aggregate measure of an observation.  
How will you rate your opinions on the following statements about immigrants?  
Do you mind immigrants being citizens of your country  Yes No 
Do you mind immigrants living in your own neighborhood  Yes No 
Would you mind living next door to an immigrant  Yes No 
Would you mind having an immigrant as your close friend  Yes No 
Would you mind if someone in your family married an immigrant  Yes No

Scaling  
The previous section discussed how to measure respondents’ responses to predesigned 
items or indicators belonging to an underlying construct.  But how do we create the indicators 
themselves?  The process of creating the indicators is called scaling .  More formally, scaling  is a 
branch of measurement that involves the construction of measures by associating qualitative 
judgments about unobservable constructs with quantitative, measurable metric units.  Stevens 
(1946) said, “Scaling is the assignment of objects to numbers according to a rule.”  This process 
of measuring abstract concepts in concrete terms remains one of the most difficult tasks in 
empirical social science research.  
The outcome of a scaling process is a scale , which is an empirical stru cture for 
measuring items or indicators of a given construct.  Understand that “ scales”, as discussed in 
this section, are a little different from “rating scales” discussed in the previous section.  A rating 
scale is used to capture the respondents’ reacti ons to a given item, for instance, such as a 
nominal scaled item captures a yes/no reaction and an interval scaled item captures a value 
between “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”  Attaching a rating scale to a statement or 
instrument is not scaling.   Rather, scaling is the formal process of developing scale items, before 
rating scales can be attached to those items.  
Scales can be unidimensional or multidimensional, based on whether the underlying 
construct is unidimensional (e.g., weight, wind speed,  firm size) or multidimensional (e.g., 
academic aptitude, intelligence).  Unidimensional scale measures constructs along a single scale, 
ranging from high to low.  Note that some of these scales may include multiple items, but all of 
these items attempt to  measure the same underlying dimension.  This is particularly the case

 dimension going from low to high.  Multi -dimensional scales, on the other hand, employ 
differ ent items or tests to measure each dimension of the construct separately, and then 
combine the scores on each dimension to create an overall measure of the multidimensional 
construct.  For instance, academic aptitude can be measured using two separate test s of 
students’ mathematical and verbal ability, and then combining these scores to create an overall 
measure for academic aptitude.  Since most scales employed in social science research are 
unidimensional, we will next three examine approaches for creatin g unidimensional scales.  
Unidimensional scaling methods were developed during the first half of the twentieth 
century and were named after their creators.  The three most popular unidimensional scaling 
methods are: (1) Thurstone’s equal -appearing scaling, (2) Likert’s summative scaling, and (3) 
Guttman’s cumulative scaling.  The three approaches are similar in many respects, with the key 
differences being the rating of the scale items by judges and the statistical methods used to 
select the final items.  Ea ch of these methods are discussed next.  
 Thurstone’s equal -appearing scaling method.   Louis Thurstone. one of the earliest 
and most famous scaling theorists, published a method of equal -appearing intervals in 1925.  
This method starts with a clear conceptu al definition of the construct of interest.  Based on this 
definition, potential scale items are generated to measure this construct.  These items are 
generated by experts who know something about the construct being measured.  The initial 
pool of candidat e items (ideally 80 to 100 items) should be worded in a similar manner, for 
instance, by framing them as statements to which respondents may agree or disagree (and not 
as questions or other things).  Next, a panel of judges is recruited to select specific items from 
this candidate pool to represent the construct of interest.  Judges may include academics 
trained in the process of instrument construction or a random sample of respondents of 
interest (i.e., people who are familiar with the phenomenon).  The s election process is done by 
having each judge independently rate each item on a scale from 1 to 11 based on how closely, in 
their opinion, that item reflects the intended construct (1 represents extremely unfavorable and 
11 represents extremely favorable).   For each item, compute the median and inter -quartile 
range (the difference between the 75th and the 25th percentile – a measure of dispersion), which 
are plotted on a histogram, as shown in Figure 6.1.  The final scale items are selected as 
statements th at are at equal intervals across a range of medians.  This can be done by grouping 
items with a common median, and then selecting the item with the smallest inter -quartile range 
within each median group.  However, instead of relying entirely on statistical  analysis for item 
selection, a better strategy may be to examine the candidate items at each level and selecting 
the statement that is the most clear and makes the most sense.  The median value of each scale 
item represents the weight to be used for aggre gating the items into a composite scale score 
representing the construct of interest.  We now have a scale which looks like a ruler, with one 
item or statement at each of the 11 points on the ruler (and weighted as such).  Because items 
appear equally thro ughout the entire 11 -pointrange of the scale, this technique is called an 
equal -appearing scale.   
 Thurstone also created two additional methods of building unidimensional scales – the 
method of successive intervals  and the method of paired comparisons  – which are both very 
similar to the method of equal -appearing intervals, except for how judges are asked to rate the 
data.  For instance, the method of paired comparison requires each judge to make a judgment 
between each pair of statements (rather than rat e each statement independently on a 1 to 11 
scale).  Hence, the name paired comparison method.  With a lot of statements, this approach can 
be enormously time consuming and unwieldy compared to the method of equal -appearing 
intervals.

 Likert’s summative scaling method .  The Likert method, a unidimensional scaling 
method developed by Murphy and Likert (1938), is quite possibly the most popular of the three 
scaling approaches described in this chapte r.  As with Thurstone’s method, the Likert method 
also starts with a clear definition of the construct of interest, and using a set of experts to 
generate about 80 to 100 potential scale items.  These items are then rated by judges on a 1 to 5 
(or 1 to 7) rating scale as follows: 1 for strongly disagree with the concept, 2 for somewhat 
disagree with the concept, 3 for undecided, 4 for somewhat agree with the concept, and 5 for 
strongly agree with the concept.  Following this rating, specific items can be se lected for the 
final scale can be selected in one of several ways: (1) by computing bivariate correlations 
between judges rating of each item and the total item (created by summing all individual items 
for each respondent), and throwing out items with low (e.g., less than 0.60) item -to-total 
correlations, or (2) by averaging the rating for each item for the top quartile and the bottom 
quartile of judges, doing a t -test for the difference in means, and selecting items that have high 
t-values (i.e., those tha t discriminates best between the top and bottom quartile responses).  In 
the end, researcher’s judgment may be used to obtain a relatively small (say 10 to 15) set of 
items that have high item -to-total correlations and high discrimination (i.e., high t -values).  The 
Likert method assumes equal weights for all items, and hence, respondent’s responses to each 
item can be summed to create a composite score for that respondent.  Hence, this method is 
called a summated scale.  Note that any item with reversed me aning from the original direction 
of the construct must be reverse coded (i.e., 1 becomes a 5, 2 becomes a 4, and so forth) before 
summating.  
 Guttman’s cumulative scaling method .  Designed by Guttman (1950), the cumulative 
scaling method is based on Emory  Bogardus’ social distance technique, which assumes that 
people’s willingness to participate in social relations with other people vary in degrees of 
intensity, and measures that intensity using a list of items arranged from “least intense” to 
“most intens e”.  The idea is that people who agree with one item on this list also agree with all 
previous items.  In practice, we seldom find a set of items that matches this cumulative pattern 
perfectly.  A scalogram analysis is used to examine how closely a set of items corresponds to the 
idea of cumulativeness.   
 Like previous scaling methods, the Guttman method also starts with a clear definition of 
the construct of interest, and then using experts to develop a large set of candidate items.  A 
group of judges the n rate each candidate item as “yes” if they view the item as being favorable 

52 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 to the construct and “no” if they see the item as unfavorable.  Next, a matrix or table is created 
showing the judges’ responses to all candidate items.  This matrix is sorted in decreasing order 
from judges with more “yes” at the top to those with fewer “yes” at the bottom.  Judges with the 
same number of “yes”, the statements can be sorted from left to right based on most number of 
agreements to least.  The resulting matrix will resemble Table 6.6.  Notice that the scale is now 
almost cumulative when read from left to right (across the items).  However, there may be a few 
exceptions, as shown in Table 6.6, and hence the scale is not entirely cumulative.  To determine 
a set of item s that best approximates the cumulativeness property, a data analysis technique 
called scalogram analysis can be used (or this can be done visually if the number of items is 
small).  The statistical technique also estimates a score for each item that can b e used to 
compute a respondent’s overall score on the entire set of items.  
Respondent  Item 12  Item 5  Item 3  Item 22  Item 8  Item 7  … 
29 Y Y Y Y Y Y  
7 Y Y Y - Y -  
15 Y Y Y Y - -  
3 Y Y Y Y - -  
32 Y Y Y - - -  
4 Y Y - Y - -  
5 Y Y - - - -  
23 Y Y - - - -  
11 Y - - Y - -  
Y indicates exceptions that prevents this matrix from being perfectly cumulative

Indexes  
An index  is a composite score derived from aggregating measures of multiple  constructs  
(called components) using a set of rules and formulas.  It is different from scales in that scales 
also aggregate measures, but these measures measure different dimensions or the same 
dimension of a single construct .  A well -known example of an index is the consumer price index 
(CPI), which is computed every month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department 
of Labor.  The CPI is a measure of how much consumers have to pay for goods and services in 
general, and is divided into eight m ajor categories (food and beverages, housing, apparel, 
transportation, healthcare, recreation, education and communication, and “other goods and 
services”), which are further subdivided into more than 200 smaller items.  Each month, 
government employees ca ll all over the country to get the current prices of more than 80,000 
items.  Using a complicated weighting scheme that takes into account the location and 
probability of purchase of each item, these prices are combined by analysts, which are then 
combined  into an overall index score using a series of formulas and rules.   
M e a s u r e m e n t  o f  C o n s t r u c t s  | 53 
 
 
 Another example of index is socio -economic status (SES), also called the Duncan 
socioeconomic index (SEI).  This index is a combination of three constructs: income, education, 
and occupat ion.  Income is measured in dollars, education in years or degrees achieved, and 
occupation is classified into categories or levels by status.  These very different measures are 
combined to create an overall SES index score, using a weighted combination of  “occupational 
education” (percentage of people in that occupation who had one or more year of college 
education) and “occupational income” (percentage of people in that occupation who earned 
more than a specific annual income).  However, SES index measure ment has generated a lot of 
controversy and disagreement among researchers.  
The process of creating an index is similar to that of a scale.  First, conceptualize (define) 
the index and its constituent components.  Though this appears simple, there may be a  lot of 
disagreement among judges on what components (constructs) should be included or excluded 
from an index.  For instance, in the SES index, isn’t income correlated with education and 
occupation, and if so, should we include one component only or all t hree components?  
Reviewing the literature, using theories, and/or interviewing experts or key stakeholders may 
help resolve this issue.  Second, operationalize and measure each component.  For instance, 
how will you categorize occupations, particularly si nce some occupations may have changed 
with time (e.g., there were no Web developers before the Internet).  Third, create a rule or 
formula for calculating the index score.  Again, this process may involve a lot of subjectivity.  
Lastly, validate the index score using existing or new data.  
Though indexes and scales yield a single numerical score or value representing a 
construct of interest, they are different in many ways.  First, indexes often comprise of 
components that are very different from each other (e.g., income, education, and occupation in 
the SES index) and are measured in different ways.  However, scales typically involve a set of 
similar items that use the same rating scale (such as a five -point Likert scale).  Second, indexes 
often combine obje ctively measurable values such as prices or income, while scales are 
designed to assess subjective or judgmental constructs such as attitude, prejudice, or self -
esteem.  Some argue that the sophistication of the scaling methodology makes scales different 
from indexes, while others suggest that indexing methodology can be equally sophisticated.  
Nevertheless, indexes and scales are both essential tools in social science research.  
Typologies  
Scales and indexes generate ordinal measures of unidimensional const ructs.  However, 
researchers sometimes wish to summarize measures of two or more constructs to create a set 
of categories or types called a typology .  Unlike scales or indexes, typologies are multi -
dimensional but include only nominal variables.  For insta nce, one can create a political 
typology of newspapers based on their orientation toward domestic and foreign policy, as 
expressed in their editorial columns, as shown in Figure 6.2.  This typology can be used to 
categorize newspapers into one of four “ide al types” (A through D), identify the distribution of 
newspapers across these ideal types, and perhaps even create a classificatory model to 
classifying newspapers into one of these four ideal types depending on other attributes.

Summary  
In closing, scale (or index) construction in social science research is a complex process 
involving several key decisions.  Some of these decisions are:  
 Should you use a scale, index, or typology?  
 How do  you plan to analyze the data?  
 What is your desired level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) or 
rating scale?  
 How many scale attributes should you use (e.g., 1 to 10; 1 to 7; −3 to +3)?  
 Should you use an odd or even number of attributes (i.e., do you wish to have neutral or 
mid -point value)?  
 How do you wish to label the scale attributes (especially for semantic differential 
scales)?  
 Finally, what procedure would you use to generate the scale items (e.g., Thurstone, 
Likert, or Guttman meth od) or index components?  
 
This chapter examined the process and outcomes of scale development.  The next chapter will 
examine how to evaluate the reliability and validity of the scales developed using the above 
approaches.

Chapter 7  
 
Scale Reliability and Validity  
 
 
 The previous chapter examined some of the difficulties with measuring constructs in 
social science research.  For instance, how do we know whether we are measuring 
“compassion” and not the “empathy”, since both constructs are somewhat similar in meaning?  
Or is compassion the same thing as empathy?  What makes it more complex is that sometimes 
these constructs are imaginary concepts (i.e., they don’t exist in reality), and multi -dimensional 
(in which case, we have the added problem of identifying their cons tituent dimensions).  Hence, 
it is not adequate just to measure social science constructs using any scale that we prefer.  We 
also must test these scales to ensure that: (1) these scales indeed measure the unobservable 
construct that we wanted to measure ( i.e., the scales are “valid”), and (2) they measure the 
intended construct consistently and precisely (i.e., the scales are “reliable”).  Reliability and 
validity, jointly called the “psychometric properties” of measurement scales, are the yardsticks 
again st which the adequacy and accuracy of our measurement procedures are evaluated in 
scientific research.   
A measure can be reliable but not valid, if it is measuring something very consistently 
but is consistently measuring the wrong construct.  Likewise, a  measure can be valid but not 
reliable if it is measuring the right construct, but not doing so in a consistent manner.  Using the 
analogy of a shooting target, as shown in Figure 7.1, a multiple -item measure of a construct that 
is both reliable and valid consists of shots that clustered within a narrow range near the center 
of the target.  A measure that is valid but not reliable will consist of shots centered on the target 
but not clustered within a narrow range, but rather scattered around the target.  F inally, a 
measure that is reliable but not valid will consist of shots clustered within a narrow range but 
off from the target.  Hence, r eliability and validity are both needed to assure adequate 
measurement of the constructs of interest.

 Reliability  
   Reliability  is the degree to which the measure of a construct is consistent or 
dependable.  In other words, if we use this scale to measure the same construct multiple times, 
do we get pretty much the sa me result every time, assuming the underlying phenomenon is not 
changing?  An example of an unreliable measurement is people guessing your weight.  Quite 
likely, people will guess differently, the different measures will be inconsistent, and therefore, 
the “guessing” technique of measurement is unreliable.  A more reliable measurement may be 
to use a weight scale, where you are likely to get the same value every time you step on the 
scale, unless your weight has actually changed between measurements.   
 Note that reliability implies consistency but not accuracy.  In the previous example of 
the weight scale, if the weight scale is calibrated incorrectly (say, to shave off ten pounds from 
your true weight, just to make you feel better!), it will not measure yo ur true weight and is 
therefore not a valid measure.  Nevertheless, the miscalibrated weight scale will still give you 
the same weight every time (which is ten pounds less than your true weight), and hence the 
scale is reliable.  
 What are the sources of un reliable observations in social science measurements?  One of 
the primary sources is the observer’s (or researcher’s) subjectivity.  If employee morale in a 
firm is measured by watching whether the employees smile at each other, whether they make 
jokes, an d so forth, then different observers may infer different measures of morale if they are 
watching the employees on a very busy day (when they have no time to joke or chat) or a light 
day (when they are more jovial or chatty).  Two observers may also infer d ifferent levels of 
morale on the same day, depending on what they view as a joke and what is not.  “Observation” 
is a qualitative measurement technique.  Sometimes, reliability may be improved by using 
quantitative measures, for instance, by counting the n umber of grievances filed over one month 
as a measure of (the inverse of) morale.  Of course, grievances may or may not be a valid 
measure of morale, but it is less subject to human subjectivity, and therefore more reliable.  A 
second source of unreliable observation is asking imprecise or ambiguous questions.  For 
instance, if you ask people what their salary is, different respondents may interpret this 
question differently as monthly salary, annual salary, or per hour wage, and hence, the resulting 
observ ations will likely be highly divergent and unreliable.  A third source of unreliability is 
asking questions about issues that respondents are not very familiar about or care about, such 
as asking an American college graduate whether he/she is satisfied wit h Canada’s relationship 
with Slovenia, or asking a Chief Executive Officer to rate the effectiveness of his company’s 
technology strategy – something that he has likely delegated to a technology executive.   
 So how can you create reliable measures?  If yo ur measurement involves soliciting 
information from others, as is the case with much of social science research, then you can start 
by replacing data collection techniques that depends more on researcher subjectivity (such as 
observations) with those that are less dependent on subjectivity (such as questionnaire), by 
asking only those questions that respondents may know the answer to or issues that they care 
about, by avoiding ambiguous items in your measures (e.g., by clearly stating whether you are 
lookin g for annual salary), and by simplifying the wording in your indicators so that they not 
misinterpreted by some respondents (e.g., by avoiding difficult words whose meanings they 
may not know).  These strategies can improve the reliability of our measures,  even though they 
will not necessarily make the measurements completely reliable.  Measurement instruments 
must still be tested for reliability.  There are many ways of estimating reliability, which are 
discussed next.  
S c a l e  R e l i a b i l i t y  a n d  V a l i d i t y  | 57 
 
 
  Inter -rater reliability .  Inter -rater reliability, also called inter -observer reliability, is a 
measure of consistency between two or more independent raters (observers) of the same 
construct.  Usually, this is assessed in a pilot study, and can be done in two ways, depending on 
the level of measurement of the construct.  If the measure is categorical, a set of all categories is 
defined, raters check off which category each observation falls in, and the percentage of 
agreement between the raters is an estimate of inter -rater reliabi lity.  For instance, if there are 
two raters rating 100 observations into one of three possible categories, and their ratings match 
for 75% of the observations, then inter -rater reliability is 0.75.  If the measure is interval or 
ratio scaled (e.g., classr oom activity is being measured once every 5 minutes by two raters on 1 
to 7 response scale), then a simple correlation between measures from the two raters can also 
serve as an estimate of inter -rater reliability.  
 Test -retest reliability .  Test -retest rel iability is a measure of consistency between two 
measurements (tests) of the same construct administered to the same sample at two different 
points in time.  If the observations have not changed substantially between the two tests, then 
the measure is reli able. The correlation in observations between the two tests is an estimate of 
test-retest reliability.  Note here that the time interval between the two tests is critical.  
Generally, the longer is the time gap, the greater is the chance that the two obser vations may 
change during this time (due to random error), and the lower will be the test -retest reliability.   
 Split -half reliability .  Split -half reliability is a measure of consistency between two 
halves of a construct measure.  For instance, if you ha ve a ten -item measure of a given 
construct, randomly split those ten items into two sets of five (unequal halves are allowed if the 
total number of items is odd), and administer the entire instrument to a sample of respondents.  
Then, calculate the total s core for each half for each respondent, and the correlation between 
the total scores in each half is a measure of split -half reliability.  The longer is the instrument, 
the more likely it is that the two halves of the measure will be similar (since random errors are 
minimized as more items are added), and hence, this technique t ends to systematically 
over estimate the reliability of longer instruments.  
 Internal consistency reliability .  Internal consistency reliability is a measure of 
consistency between di fferent items of the same construct.  If a multiple -item construct 
measure is administered to respondents, the extent to which respondents rate those items in a 
similar manner is a reflection of internal consistency.  This reliability can be estimated in t erms 
of average inter -item correlation, average item -to-total correlation, or more commonly, 
Cronbach’s alpha.  As an example, if you have a scale with six items, you will have fifteen 
different item pairings, and fifteen correlations between these six ite ms.  Average inter -item 
correlation is the average of these fifteen correlations.  To calculate average item -to-total 
correlation, you have to first create a “total” item by adding the values of all six items, compute 
the correlations between this total it em and each of the six individual items, and finally, average 
the six correlations.  Neither of the two above measures takes into account the number of items 
in the measure (six items in this example).  Cronbach’s alpha, a reliability measure designed by 
Lee Cronbach in 1951, factors in scale size in reliability estimation, calculated using the 
following formula:  
 

58 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 where K is the number of items in the measure,  is the variance (square of standard 
deviation) of the observed total scores, and  is the obser ved variance for item i.  The 
standardized Cronbach’s alpha can be computed using a simpler formula:  
 
where K is the number of items,  is the average inter -item correlation, i.e., the mean of K(K-
1)/2 coefficients  in  the upper triangular (or lower triangular) correlation matrix . 
Validity  
 Validity , often called construct validity, refers to the extent to which a measure 
adequately represents the underlying construct that it is supposed to measure.  For instance, is 
a measure of compassion really measuring compassion, and not measuring a different construct 
such as empathy?  Validity can be assessed using theoretical or empirical approaches, and 
should ideally be measured using both approaches.  Theoretical assessment o f validity focuses 
on how well the idea of a theoretical construct is translated into or represented in an 
operational measure.  This type of validity is called translational validity  (or representational 
validity), and consists of two subtypes: face and c ontent validity.  Translational validity is 
typically assessed using a panel of expert judges, who rate each item (indicator) on how well 
they fit the conceptual definition of that construct, and a qualitative technique called Q -sort.   
Empirical assessmen t of validity examines how well a given measure relates to one or 
more external criterion, based on empirical observations.  This type of validity is called 
criterion -related validity , which includes  four sub -types:  convergent, discriminant, 
concurrent, an d predictive validity.  While translation validity examines whether a measure is a 
good reflection of its underlying construct, criterion -related validity examines whether a given 
measure behaves the way it should, given the theory of that construct.  This  assessment is based 
on quantitative analysis of observed data using statistical techniques such as correlational 
analysis, factor analysis, and so forth.  The distinction between theoretical and empirical 
assessment of validity is illustrated in Figure 7. 2.  However, both approaches are needed to 
adequately ensure the validity of measures in social science research.  
Note that the different types of validity discussed here refer to the validity of the 
measurement procedures , which is distinct from the validity of hypotheses testing procedures , 
such as internal validity (causality), external validity (generalizability), or statistical conclusion 
validity.  The latter types of validity are discussed in a later chapter.  
 Face v alidity .  Face validity refers to whether an indicator seems to be a reasonable 
measure of its underlying construct “on its face”.  For instance, the frequency of one’s 
attendance at religious services seems to make sense as an indication of a person’s religiosit y 
without a lot of explanation.  Hence this indicator has face validity.  However, if we were to 
suggest how many books were checked out of an office library as a measure of employee 
morale, then such a measure would probably lack face validity because it does not seem to 
make much sense.  Interestingly, some of the popular measures used in organizational research 
appears to lack face validity.  For instance, absorptive capacity of an organization (how much 
new knowledge can it assimilate for improving orga nizational processes) has often been 
measured as research and development intensity (i.e., R&D expenses divided by gross 
revenues)!  If your research includes constructs that are highly abstract or constructs that are 

S c a l e  R e l i a b i l i t y  a n d  V a l i d i t y  | 59 
 
 
 hard to conceptually separate from eac h other (e.g., compassion and empathy), it may be 
worthwhile to consider using a panel of experts to evaluate the face validity of your construct 
measures.  
 
Figure 7.2.  Two approaches of validity assessment  
 
 Content validity .  Content validity is an asse ssment of how well a set of scale items 
matches with the relevant content domain of the construct that it is trying to measure.  For 
instance, if you want to measure the construct “satisfaction with restaurant service,” and you 
define the content domain of  restaurant service as including the quality of food, courtesy of wait 
staff, duration of wait, and the overall ambience of the restaurant (i.e., whether it is noisy, 
smoky, etc.), then for adequate content validity, this construct should be measured using  
indicators that examine the extent to which a restaurant patron is satisfied with the quality of 
food, courtesy of wait staff, the length of wait, and the restaurant’s ambience.  Of course, this 
approach requires a detailed description of the entire conte nt domain of a construct, which may 
be difficult for complex constructs such as self -esteem or intelligence.  Hence, it may not be 
always possible to adequately assess content validity.  As with face validity, an expert panel of 
judges may be employed to e xamine content validity of constructs.  
Convergent validity  refers to the closeness with which a measure relates to (or 
converges on) the construct that it is purported to measure, and discriminant validity  refers 
to the degree to which a measure does not m easure (or discriminates from) other constructs 
that it is not supposed to measure.  Usually, convergent validity and discriminant validity are 
assessed jointly for a set of related constructs.  For instance, if you expect that an organization’s 
knowledge is related to its performance, how can you assure that your measure of 
organizational knowledge is indeed measuring organizational knowledge (for convergent 
validity) and not organizational performance (for discriminant validity)?  Convergent validity 
can be established by comparing the observed values of one indicator of one construct with that 
of other indicators of the same construct and demonstrating similarity (or high correlation) 
between values of these indicators.  Discriminant validity is establish ed by demonstrating that 
indicators of one construct are dissimilar from (i.e., have low correlation with) other constructs.  
In the above example, if we have a three -item measure of organizational knowledge and three 
more items for organizational performa nce, based on observed sample data, we can compute 

60 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 bivariate correlations between each pair of knowledge and performance items.  If this 
correlation matrix shows high correlations within items of the organizational knowledge and 
organizational performance constructs, but low correlations between items of these constructs, 
then we have simultaneously demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity (see Table 
7.1).  
 
Table 7.1.  Bivariate correlational analysis for convergent and discriminant validity  
 
An a lternative and more common statistical method used to demonstrate convergent 
and discriminant validity is exploratory factor analysis .  This is a data reduction technique which 
aggregates a given set of items to a smaller set of factors based on the bivari ate correlation 
structure discussed above using a statistical technique called principal components analysis.  
These factors should ideally correspond to the underling theoretical constructs that we are 
trying to measure.  The general norm for factor extra ction is that each extracted factor should 
have an eigenvalue greater than 1.0.  The extracted factors can then be rotated using orthogonal 
or oblique rotation techniques, depending on whether the underlying constructs are expected 
to be relatively uncorre lated or correlated, to generate factor weights that can be used to 
aggregate the individual items of each construct into a composite measure.  For adequate 
convergent validity, it is expected that items belonging to a common construct should exhibit 
facto r loadings of 0.60 or higher on a single factor (called same -factor loadings), while for 
discriminant validity, these items should have factor loadings of 0.30 or less on all other factors 
(cross -factor loadings), as shown in rotated factor matrix example in Table 7.2.  A more 
sophisticated technique for evaluating convergent and discriminant validity is the multi -trait 
multi -method (MTMM) approach.  This technique requires measuring each construct (trait) 
using two or more different methods (e.g., survey a nd personal observation, or perhaps survey 
of two different respondent groups such as teachers and parents for evaluating academic 
quality).  This is an onerous and relatively less popular approach, and is therefore not discussed 
here.  
 Criterion -related v alidity can also be assessed based on whether a given measure relate 
well with a current or future criterion, which are respectively called concurrent and predictive 
validity.   Predictive validity  is the degree to which a measure successfully predicts a fu ture 
outcome that it is theoretically expected to predict.  For instance, can standardized test scores 
(e.g., Scholastic Aptitude Test scores) correctly predict the academic success in college (e.g., as 
measured by college grade point average)?   Assessing  such validity requires creation of a 
“nomological network” showing how constructs are theoretically related to each other.  
Concurrent validity  examines how well one measure relates to other concrete criterion that is 
presumed to occur simultaneously.  Fo r instance, do students’ scores in a calculus class 

S c a l e  R e l i a b i l i t y  a n d  V a l i d i t y  | 61 
 
 
 correlate well with their scores in a linear algebra class?  These scores should be related 
concurrently because they are both tests of mathematics.  Unlike convergent and discriminant 
validity, concurren t and predictive validity is frequently ignored in empirical social science 
research.

Theory of Measurement  
 Now that we know the different kinds of reliability and validity, let us try to synthesize 
our understanding of reliability and validity in a mathematical manner using classical test 
theory , also called true score theory .  This is a psychometric theory tha t examines how 
measurement works, what it measures, and what it does not measure.  This theory postulates 
that every observation has a true score  T that can be observed accurately if there were no errors 
in measurement.  However, the presence of measuremen t errors  E results in a deviation of the 
observed score  X from the true score as follows:  
X              =             T             +           E  
     Observed score         True score               Error  
 
Across a set of observed scores, the variance of observed and true scores can be related using a 
similar equation:  
var(X)        =          var(T)        +         var(E)  
The goal of psychometric analysis is to estimate and minimize if possible the error variance 
var(E), so that the observed score X is a  good measure of the true score T.   
 Measurement errors can be of two types: random error and systematic error.  Random 
error  is the error that can be attributed to a set of unknown and uncontrollable external factors 
that randomly influence some observat ions but not others.  As an example, during the time of 
measurement, some respondents may be in a nicer mood than others, which may influence how 
they respond to the measurement items.  For instance, respondents in a nicer mood may 
respond more positively to constructs like self -esteem, satisfaction, and happiness than those 
who are in a poor mood.  However, it is not possible to anticipate which subject is in what type 
of mood or control for the effect of mood in research studies.  Likewise, at an organiza tional 
level, if we are measuring firm performance, regulatory or environmental changes may affect 
the performance of some firms in an observed sample but not others.  Hence, random error is 
considered to be “noise” in measurement and generally ignored.  

62 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
  Systematic error  is an error that is introduced by factors that systematically affect all 
observations of a construct across an entire sample in a systematic manner.  In our previous 
example of firm performance, since the recent financial crisis impacted th e performance of 
financial firms disproportionately more than any other type of firms such as manufacturing or 
service firms, if our sample consisted only of financial firms, we may expect a systematic 
reduction in performance of all firms in our sample du e to the financial crisis.  Unlike random 
error, which may be positive negative, or zero, across observation in a sample, systematic 
errors tends to be consistently positive or negative across the entire sample.  Hence, systematic 
error is sometimes consid ered to be “bias” in measurement and should be corrected.  
 Since an observed score may include both random and systematic errors, our true score 
equation can be modified as:  
X             =            T          +         E r          +         E s 
where E r and E s represent random and systematic errors respectively.  The statistical impact of 
these errors is that random error adds variability (e.g., standard deviation) to the distribution 
of an observed measure, but does not affect its central tendency (e.g.,  mean), while systematic 
error affects the central tendency but not the variability, as shown in Figure 7.3.  
 
Figure 7.3.  Effects of random and systematic errors  
 
 What does random and systematic error imply for measurement procedures?  By 
increasing vari ability in observations, random error reduces the reliability of measurement.  In 
contrast, by shifting the central tendency measure, systematic error reduces the validity of 
measurement.  Validity concerns are far more serious problems in measurement than  reliability 
concerns, because an invalid measure is probably measuring a different construct than what we 
intended, and hence validity problems cast serious doubts on findings derived from statistical 
analysis.   
 Note that reliability is a ratio or a fra ction that captures how close the true score is 
relative to the observed score.  Hence, reliability can be expressed as:  
var(T) / var(X)  =  var(T) / [ var(T) + var(E) ]  
If var(T) = var(X), then the true score has the same variability as the observed score , and the 
reliability is 1.0.

 An Integrated Approach to Measurement Validation  
 A complete and adequate assessment of validity must include both theoretical and 
empirical approaches.  As shown in Figure 7.4, this is an elaborate multi -step process that m ust 
take into account the different types of scale reliability and validity.  
 
Figure 7.4 . An integrated approach to measurement validation  
 
 The integrated approach starts in the theoretical realm.  The first step is conceptualizing 
the constructs of interest.  This includes defining each construct and identifying their 
constituent domains and/or dimensions.  Next, we select (or create) items or indicators for each 
construct based on our conceptualization of these construct, as described in the scaling  
procedure in Chapter 5.  A literature review may also be helpful in indicator selection.  Each 
item is reworded in a uniform manner using simple and easy -to-understand text.  Following 
this step, a panel of expert judges (academics experienced in research  methods and/or a 
representative set of target respondents) can be employed to examine each indicator and 
conduct a Q -sort analysis.  In this analysis, each judge is given a list of all constructs with their 
conceptual definitions and a stack of index card s listing each indicator for each of the construct 
measures (one indicator per index card).  Judges are then asked to independently read each 
index card, examine the clarity, readability, and semantic meaning of that item, and sort it with 
the construct wh ere it seems to make the most sense, based on the construct definitions 
provided.  Inter -rater reliability is assessed to examine the extent to which judges agreed with 
their classifications.  Ambiguous items that were consistently missed by many judges ma y be 
reexamined, reworded, or dropped.  The best items (say 10 -15) for each construct are selected 
for further analysis.  Each of the selected items is reexamined by judges for face validity and 
content validity.  If an adequate set of items is not achieve d at this stage, new items may have to 
be created based on the conceptual definition of the intended construct.  Two or three rounds of 
Q-sort may be needed to arrive at reasonable agreement between judges on a set of items that 
best represents the constru cts of interest.  
 Next, the validation procedure moves to the empirical realm.  A research instrument is 
created comprising all of the refined construct items, and is administered to a pilot test group of 
representative respondents from the target populati on.  Data collected is tabulated and 

64 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 subjected to correlational analysis or exploratory factor analysis using a software program such 
as SAS or SPSS for assessment of convergent and discriminant validity.  Items that do not meet 
the expected norms of facto r loading (same -factor loadings higher than 0.60, and cross -factor 
loadings less than 0.30) should be dropped at this stage.  The remaining scales are evaluated for 
reliability using a measure of internal consistency such as Cronbach alpha.  Scale dimensio nality 
may also be verified at this stage, depending on whether the targeted constructs were 
conceptualized as being unidimensional or multi -dimensional.  Next, evaluate the predictive 
ability of each construct within a theoretically specified nomological network of construct using 
regression analysis or structural equation modeling.  If the construct measures satisfy most or 
all of the requirements of reliability and validity described in this chapter, we can be assured 
that our operationalized measures ar e reasonably adequate and accurate.  
 The integrated approach to measurement validation discussed here is quite demanding 
of researcher time and effort.  Nonetheless, this elaborate multi -stage process is needed to 
ensure that measurement scales used in our  research meets the expected norms of scientific 
research.  Because inferences drawn using flawed or compromised scales are meaningless, scale 
validation and measurement remains one of the most important and involved phase of 
empirical research.

Sampling  
 
 
 Sampling  is the statistical  process of selecting a subset (called a “sample”) of a 
population of interest for purposes of making observations and statistical inferences about 
that  population .  Social  science research is generally about inferring patterns of behaviors 
within specific populations.  We cannot study entire populations because of feasibility and cost 
constraints, and hence, we must selec t a representative sample from the population of interest 
for observation and analysis.  It is extremely important to choose a sample that is truly 
representative of the population so that the inferences derived from the sample can be 
generalized back to t he population of interest.  Improper and biased sampling is the primary 
reason for often divergent and erroneous inferences reported in opinion polls and exit polls 
conducted by different polling groups such as CNN/Gallup Poll, ABC, and CBS, prior to every  U.S. 
Presidential elections.   
The Sampling Process  
 
Figure 8.1.  The sampling process  
 
   The sampling process comprises of several stage.  The first stage is defining the target 
population.  A population  can be defined as all people or items ( unit of analysis ) with the 
characteristics that one wishes to study.  The unit of analysis may be a person, group, 

66 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 organization, country, object, or any other entity that you wish to draw scientific inferences 
about.  Sometimes the population is obvious.  For exam ple, if a manufacturer wants to 
determine whether finished goods manufactured at a production line meets certain quality 
requirements or must be scrapped and reworked, then the population consists of the entire set 
of finished goods manufactured at that pr oduction facility.  At other times, the target population 
may be a little harder to understand.  If you wish to identify the primary drivers of academic 
learning among high school students, then what is your target population: high school students, 
their t eachers, school principals, or parents?  The right answer in this case is high school 
students, because you are interested in their performance, not the performance of their 
teachers, parents, or schools.  Likewise, if you wish to analyze the behavior of r oulette wheels to 
identify biased wheels, your population of interest is not different observations from a single 
roulette wheel, but different roulette wheels (i.e., their behavior over an infinite set of wheels).  
 The second step in the sampling process is to choose a sampling frame .  This is an 
accessible section of the target population (usually a list with contact information) from where 
a sample can be drawn.  If your target population is professional employees at work, because 
you cannot access all p rofessional employees around the world, a more realistic sampling frame 
will be employee lists of one or two local companies that are willing to participate in your study.  
If your target population is organizations, then the Fortune 500 list of firms or t he Standard & 
Poor’s (S&P) list of firms registered with the New York Stock exchange may be acceptable 
sampling frames.  
 Note that sampling frames may not entirely be representative of the population at large, 
and if so, inferences derived by such a sample  may not be generalizable to the population.  For 
instance, if your target population is organizational employees at large (e.g., you wish to study 
employee self -esteem in this population) and your sampling frame is employees at automotive 
companies in the  American Midwest, findings from such groups may not even be generalizable 
to the American workforce at large, let alone the global workplace.  This is because the 
American auto industry has been under severe competitive pressures for the last 50 years and  
has seen numerous episodes of reorganization and downsizing, possibly resulting in low 
employee morale and self -esteem.  Furthermore, the majority of the American workforce is 
employed in service industries or in small businesses, and not in automotive in dustry.  Hence, a 
sample of American auto industry employees is not particularly representative of the American 
workforce.  Likewise, the Fortune 500 list includes the 500 largest American enterprises, which 
is not representative of all American firms in g eneral, most of which are medium and small -
sized firms rather than large firms, and is therefore, a biased sampling frame.  In contrast, the 
S&P list will allow you to select large, medium, and/or small companies, depending on whether 
you use the S&P large -cap, mid -cap, or small -cap lists, but includes publicly traded firms (and 
not private firms) and hence still biased.  Also note that t he population from which a sample is 
drawn may not necessarily be the same as the population about which we actually want  
information.  For example, if a researcher wants to the success rate of a new “quit smoking” 
program, then the target population is the universe of smokers who had access to this program, 
which may be an unknown population.  Hence, the researcher may samp le patients arriving at a 
local medical facility for smoking cessation treatment, some of whom may not have had 
exposure to this particular “quit smoking” program, in which case, the sampling frame does not 
correspond to the population of interest.  
 The la st step in sampling is choosing a sample from the sampling frame using a well -
defined sampling technique.  Sampling techniques can be grouped into two broad categories: 
probability (random) sampling and non -probability sampling.  Probability sampling is id eal if 
S a m p l i n g  | 67 
 
 
 generalizability of results is important for your study, but there may be unique circumstances 
where non -probability sampling can also be justified.  These techniques are discussed in the 
next two sections.   
Probability Sampling  
Probability sampli ng is a technique in which every unit in the population has a chance 
(non -zero probability) of being selected in the sample, and this chance can be accurately 
determined.  Sample statistics thus produced, such as sample mean or standard deviation, are 
unbi ased estimates of population parameters, as long as the sampled units are weighted 
according to their probability of selection.  All probability sampling have two attributes in 
common: (1) every unit in the population has a known non -zero probability of be ing sampled, 
and (2) the sampling procedure involves random selection at some point.  The different types of 
probability sampling techniques include:  
Simple random sampling.   In this technique, all possible subsets of a population (more 
accurately, of a s ampling frame) are given an equal probability of being selected.   The 
probability of selecting any set of n units out of a total of N units in a sampling frame is NCn.  
Hence, sample statistics are unbiased estimates of population parameters, without any 
weighting.  Simple random sampling involves randomly selecting respondents from a sampling 
frame, but with large sampling frames, usually a table of random numbers or a computerized 
random number generator is used.  For instance, if you wish to select 200 firms to survey from 
a list of 1000 firms, if this list is entered into a spreadsheet like Excel, you can use Excel’s 
RAND() function to generate random numbers for each of the 1000 clients on that list.  Next, 
you sort the list in increasing order of thei r corresponding random number, and select the first 
200 clients on that sorted list.  This is the simplest of all probability sampling techniques; 
however, the simplicity is also the strength of this technique.  Because the sampling frame is not 
subdivided  or partitioned, the sample is unbiased and the inferences are most generalizable 
amongst all probability sampling techniques.  
Systematic sampling.   In t his technique, the sampling frame is ordered according to some 
criteria and elements are selected at regular intervals through that ordered list.  Systematic sampling 
involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every  kth element from that point 
onwards, where  k = N/n, where k is the ratio of sampling frame size N and the desired sample  size  n, and 
is formally called the sampling ratio .  It is important that the starting point is not automatically the first in 
the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first k elements on the list.   In our previous 
example of selecting 200 firms from a list of 1000 firms, you can sort the 1000 firms in increasing (or 
decreasing) order of their size (i.e., employee count or annual revenues), randomly select one of the first 
five firms on the sorted list, and then select every fifth firm on th e list.  This process will ensure that there 
is no overrepresentation of large or small firms in your sample, but rather that firms of all sizes are 
generally uniformly represented, as it is in your sampling frame.  In other words, the sample is 
representa tive of the population, at least on the basis of the sorting criterion.  
Stratified sampling.   In stratified sampling, the sampling frame is divided into 
homogeneous and non -overlapping subgroups (called “strata”), and a simple random sample is 
drawn within  each subgroup.  In the previous example of selecting 200 firms from a list of 1000 
firms, you can start by categorizing the firms based on their size as large (more than 500 
employees), medium (between 50 and 500 employees), and small (less than 50 employ ees).  
You can then randomly select 67 firms from each subgroup to make up your sample of 200 
firms.  However, since there are many more small firms in a sampling frame than large firms, 
having an equal number of small, medium, and large firms will make th e sample less 
68 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 representative of the population (i.e., biased in favor of large firms that are fewer in number in 
the target population).  This is called non-proportional  stratified sampling because the 
proportion of sample within each subgroup does not ref lect the proportions in the sampling 
frame (or the population of interest), and the smaller subgroup (large -sized firms) is over -
sampled .  An alternative technique will be to select subgroup samples in proportion to their size 
in the population.  For insta nce, if there are 100 large firms, 300 mid -sized firms, and 600 small 
firms, you can sample 20 firms from the “large” group, 60 from the “medium” group and 120 
from the “small” group.  In this case, the proportional distribution of firms in the population is 
retained in the sample, and hence this technique is called proportional  stratified sampling.  Note 
that the non -proportional approach is particularly effective in representing small subgroups, 
such as large -sized firms, and is not necessarily less repre sentative of the population compared 
to the proportional approach, as long as the findings of the non -proportional approach is 
weighted in accordance to a subgroup’s proportion in the overall population.   
Cluster sampling.   If you have a population disper sed over a wide geographic region, it 
may not be feasible to conduct a simple random sampling of the entire population.  In such case, 
it may be reasonable to divide the population into “clusters” (usually along geographic 
boundaries), randomly sample a fe w clusters, and measure all units within that cluster.  For 
instance, if you wish to sample city governments in the state of New York, rather than travel all 
over the state to interview key city officials (as you may have to do with a simple random 
sample) , you can cluster these governments based on their counties, randomly select a set of 
three counties, and then interview officials from every  official in those counties.  However, 
depending on between -cluster differences, the variability of sample estimate s in a cluster 
sample will generally be higher than that of a simple random sample, and hence the results are 
less generalizable to the population than those obtained from simple random samples.   
Matched -pairs sampling.   Sometimes, researchers may want to  compare two 
subgroups within one population based on a specific criterion.  For instance, why are some 
firms consistently more profitable than other firms?  To conduct such a study, you would have 
to categorize a sampling frame of firms into “high profita ble” firms and “low profitable firms” 
based on gross margins, earnings per share, or some other measure of profitability.  You would 
then select a simple random sample of firms in one subgroup, and match each firm in this group 
with a firm in the second su bgroup, based on its size, industry segment, and/or other matching 
criteria.  Now, you have two matched samples of high -profitability and low -profitability firms 
that you can study in greater detail.  Such matched -pairs sampling technique is often an ideal  
way of understanding bipolar differences between different subgroups within a given 
population.  
Multi -stage sampling.   The probability sampling techniques described previously are 
all examples of single -stage sampling techniques.  Depending on your sampli ng needs, you may 
combine these single -stage techniques to conduct multi -stage sampling.  For instance, you can 
stratify a list of businesses based on firm size, and then conduct systematic sampling within 
each stratum.  This is a two -stage combination of stratified and systematic sampling.  Likewise, 
you can start with a cluster of school districts in the state of New York, and within each cluster, 
select a simple random sample of schools; within each school, select a simple random sample of 
grade levels; and within each grade level, select a simple random sample of students for study.  
In this case, you have a four -stage sampling process consisting of cluster and simple random 
sampling.

 Non -Probability Sampling  
Nonprobability sampling  is a sampling technique in which some units of the 
population have  zero chance of selection or where the probability of selection cannot be 
accurately determined.  Typically, units are selected based on certain non -random criteria, such 
as quota or convenience.  Because  selection is non -random, nonprobability sampling does not 
allow the estimation of sampling errors, and may be subjected to a sampling bias.  Therefore, 
information from a sample cannot be generalized back to the population.  Types of non -
probability sampl ing techniques include:  
Convenience sampling.   Also called accidental or opportunity sampling, this is a technique in 
which a sample is drawn from that part of the population that is close to hand, readily available, or 
convenient.  For instance, if you st and outside a shopping center and hand out questionnaire surveys to 
people or interview them as they walk in, the sample of respondents you will obtain will be a 
convenience sample.  This is a non -probability sample because you are systematically excluding  all 
people who shop at other shopping centers.  The opinions that you would get from your chosen sample 
may reflect the unique characteristics of this shopping center such as the nature of its stores (e.g., high 
end-stores will attract a more affluent dem ographic), the demographic profile of its patrons, or its 
location (e.g., a shopping center close to a university will attract primarily university students with 
unique purchase habits), and therefore may not be representative of the opinions of the shoppe r 
population at large.  Hence, the scientific generalizability of such observations will be very limited.  Other 
examples of convenience sampling are sampling students registered in a certain class or sampling 
patients arriving at a certain medical clinic.   This type of sampling is most useful for pilot testing, where 
the goal is instrument testing or measurement validation rather than obtaining generalizable inferences.  
Quota sampling.   In this technique, the population is segmented into mutually -
exclusive  subgroups (just as in stratified sampling), and then a non -random set of observations 
is chosen from each subgroup to meet a predefined quota.  In proportional quota sampling , 
the proportion of respondents in each subgroup should match that of the populat ion.  For 
instance, if the American population consists of 70% Caucasians, 15% Hispanic -Americans, and 
13% African -Americans, and you wish to understand their voting preferences in an sample of 
98 people, you can stand outside a shopping center and ask peo ple their voting preferences.  
But you will have to stop asking Hispanic -looking people when you have 15 responses from that 
subgroup (or African -Americans when you have 13 responses) even as you continue sampling 
other ethnic groups, so that the ethnic co mposition of your sample matches that of the general 
American population.  Non -proportional quota sampling  is less restrictive in that you don’t 
have to achieve a proportional representation, but perhaps meet a minimum size in each 
subgroup.  In this case, you may decide to have 50 respondents from each of the three ethnic 
subgroups (Caucasians, Hispanic -Ameri cans, and African -Americans), and stop when your 
quota for each subgroup is reached.  Neither type of quota sampling will be representative of 
the American population, since depending on whether your study was conducted in a shopping 
center in New York or Kansas, your results may be entirely different.  The non -proportional 
technique is even less representative of the population but may be useful in that it allows 
capturing the opinions of small and underrepresented groups through oversampling.  
Expert sampl ing.   This is a technique where respondents are chosen in a non -random 
manner based on their expertise on the phenomenon being studied.  For instance, in order to 
understand the impacts of a new governmental policy such as the Sarbanes -Oxley Act, you can 
sample an group of corporate accountants who are familiar with this act.  The advantage of this 
approach is that since experts tend to be more familiar with the subject matter than non -
experts, opinions from a sample of experts are more credible than a samp le that includes both 
70 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 experts and non -experts, although the findings are still not generalizable to the overall 
population at large.  
Snowball sampling.   In snowball sampling, you start by identifying a few respondents 
that match the criteria for inclusion in your study, and then ask them to recommend others they 
know who also meet your selection criteria.  For instance, if you wish to survey computer 
network administrators and you know of only one or two such people, you can start with them 
and ask them to recommend others who also do network administration.  Although this method 
hardly leads to representative samples, it may sometimes be the only way to reach hard -to-
reach populations or when no sampling frame is available.   
Statistics of Sampling  
In the preceding sections, we introduced terms such as population parameter, sample 
statistic, and sampling bias.  In this section, we will try to understand what these terms mean 
and how they are related to each other.  
When you measure a certain observation from  a given unit, such as a person’s response 
to a Likert -scaled item, that observation is called a response (see Figure 8.2).  In other words, a 
response  is a measurement value provided by a sampled unit.  Each respondent will give you 
different responses to  different items in an instrument.  Responses from different respondents 
to the same item or observation can be graphed into a frequency distribution  based on their 
frequency of occurrences.  For a large number of responses in a sample, this frequency 
distribution tends to resemble a bell -shaped curve called a normal distribution , which can be 
used to estimate overall characteristics of the entire sample, such as sample mean (average of 
all observations in a sample) or standard deviation (variability or spr ead of observations in a 
sample).  These sample estimates are called sample statistics (a “statistic” is a value that is 
estimated from observed data).  Populations also have means and standard deviations that 
could be obtained if we could sample the entir e population.  However, since the entire 
population can never be sampled, population characteristics are always unknown, and are 
called population parameters  (and not “statistic” because they are not statistically estimated 
from data).  Sample statistics m ay differ from population parameters if the sample is not 
perfectly representative of the population; the difference between the two is called sampling 
error .  Theoretically, if we could gradually increase the sample size so that the sample 
approaches clos er and closer to the population, then sampling error will decrease and a sample 
statistic will increasingly approximate the corresponding population parameter.  
If a sample is truly representative of the population, then the estimated  sample statistics 
shou ld be identical to corresponding theoretical  population parameters.  How do we know if the 
sample statistics are at least reasonably close to the population parameters?  Here, we need to 
understand the concept of a sampling distribution .  Imagine that you took three different 
random samples from a given population, as shown in Figure 8.3, and for each sample, you 
derived sample statistics such as sample mean and standard deviation.  If each random sample 
was truly representative of the population, then your  three sample means from the three 
random samples will be identical (and equal to the population parameter), and the variability in 
sample means will be zero.  But this is extremely unlikely, given that each random sample will 
likely constitute a different  subset of the population, and hence, their means may be slightly 
different from each other.  However, you can take these three sample means and plot a 
frequency histogram of sample means.  If the number of such samples increases from three to 
10 to 100, t he frequency histogram becomes a sampling distribution.  Hence, a sampling 
S a m p l i n g  | 71 
 
 
 distribution is a frequency distribution of a sample statistic  (like sample mean) from a set of 
samples , while the commonly referenced frequency distribution is the distribution of a response  
(observation) from a single sample .  Just like a frequency distribution, the sampling distribution 
will also tend to have more sample statistics clustered around the mean (which presumably is 
an estimate of a population parameter), with fewer va lues scattered around the mean.  With an 
infinitely large number of samples, this distribution will approach a normal distribution.  The 
variability or spread of a sample statistic in a sampling distribution (i.e., the standard deviation 
of a sampling stat istic) is called its standard error .  In contrast, the term standard deviation is 
reserved for variability of an observed response from a single sample.   
 
Figure 8.2.  Sample Statistic  
 
 
The mean value of a sample statistic in a sampling distribution is presumed to be an 
estimate of the unknown population parameter.  Based on the spread of this sampling 
distribution (i.e., based on standard error), it is also possible to estimate confidenc e intervals 
for that prediction population parameter.  Confidence interval  is the estimated probability 
that a population parameter lies within a specific interval of sample statistic values.  All normal 
distributions tend to follow a 68 -95-99 percent rule  (see Figure 8.4), which says that over 68% 
of the cases in the distribution lie within one standard deviation of the mean value (µ + 1σ), 
over 95% of the cases in the distribution lie within two standard deviations of the mean (µ + 
2σ), and over 99% of th e cases in the distribution lie within three standard deviations of the 
mean value (µ + 3σ).  Since a sampling distribution with an infinite number of samples will 
approach a normal distribution, the same 68 -95-99 rule applies, and it can be said that:  
 (Sample statistic + one standard error) represents a 68% confidence interval for the 
population parameter.

  (Sample statistic + two standard errors) represents a 95% confidence interval for the 
population parameter.  
 (Sample statistic + three standard errors) r epresents a 99% confidence interval for the 
population parameter.  
 
 
Figure 8.3.  The sampling distribution  
 
A sample is “biased” (i.e., not representative of the population) if its sampling 
distribution cannot be estimated or if the sampling distribution violates the 68 -95-99 percent 
rule.  As an aside, note that in most regression analysis where we examine the significance of 
regression coefficients with p<0.05, we are attempting to see if the sampling statistic 
(regression coefficient) predicts the corre sponding population parameter (true effect size) with 
a 95% confidence interval.  Interestingly, the “six sigma” standard attempts to identify 
manufacturing defects outside the 99% confidence interval or six standard deviations (standard 
deviation is repre sented using the Greek letter sigma), representing significance testing at 
p<0.01.

Survey Research  
 
 
 Survey research  a research method  involving the use of  standardized questionnaires 
or interviews to collect data  about people and their preferences, thoughts, and behaviors in a 
systematic manner.  Although census surveys were conducted as early as Ancient Egypt,  survey 
as a formal research method was pioneered in the 1930 -40s by  sociologist  Paul Lazarsfeld to 
examine the effects of the  radio  on political opinion formation of the United States.  This method 
has since become a very popular method for quantitative r esearch  in the social sciences.   
The survey method can be used for descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory research.  
This method is best suited for studies that have individual people as the unit of analysis.  
Although other units of analysis, such as gr oups, organizations or dyads (pairs of organizations, 
such as buyers and sellers), are also studied using surveys, such studies often use a specific 
person from each unit as a “key informant” or a “proxy” for that unit, and such surveys may be 
subject to r espondent bias if the informant chosen does not have adequate knowledge or has a 
biased opinion about the phenomenon of interest.  For instance, Chief Executive Officers may 
not adequately know employee’s perceptions or teamwork in their own companies, and  may 
therefore be the wrong informant for studies of team dynamics or employee self -esteem.   
Survey research has several inherent strengths compared to other research methods.  
First, surveys are an excellent vehicle for measuring a wide variety of unobse rvable data, such 
as people’s preferences (e.g., political orientation), traits (e.g., self -esteem), attitudes (e.g., 
toward immigrants), beliefs (e.g., about a new law), behaviors (e.g., smoking or drinking 
behavior), or factual information (e.g., income) .  Second, survey research is also ideally suited 
for remotely collecting data about a population that is too large to observe directly.  A large 
area, such as an entire country, can be covered using mail -in, electronic mail, or telephone 
surveys using met iculous sampling to ensure that the population is adequately represented in a 
small sample.  Third, due to their unobtrusive nature and the ability to respond at one’s 
convenience, questionnaire surveys are preferred by some respondents.  Fourth, interview s 
may be the only way of reaching certain population groups such as the homeless or illegal 
immigrants for which there is no sampling frame available.  Fifth, large sample surveys may 
allow detection of small effects even while analyzing multiple variables , and depending on the 
survey design, may also allow comparative analysis of population subgroups (i.e., within -group 
and between -group analysis).  Sixth, survey research is economical in terms of researcher time, 
effort and cost than most other methods su ch as experimental research and case research.  At 
the same time, survey research also has some unique disadvantages.  It is subject to a large 
number of biases such as non -response bias, sampling bias, social desirability bias, and recall 
bias, as discuss ed in the last section of this chapter.  
74 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 Depending on how the data is collected, survey research can be divided into two broad 
categories: questionnaire surveys (which may be mail -in, group -administered, or online 
surveys), and interview surveys (which may be personal, telephone, or focus group interviews).  
Questionnaires are instruments that are completed in writing by respondents, while interviews 
are completed by the interviewer based on verbal responses provided by respondents.  As 
discussed below, each  type has its own strengths and weaknesses, in terms of their costs, 
coverage of the target population, and researcher’s flexibility in asking questions.   
Questionnaire Surveys  
 Invented by  Sir Francis Galton, a questionnaire  is a research  instrument consisting of a 
set of questions  (items) intended to capture responses from respondents in a standardized 
manner .  Questions may be unstructured or structured.  Unstructured questions ask 
respondents to provide a response in their own words, while structur ed questions ask 
respondents to select an answer from a given set of choices.  Subjects’ responses to individual 
questions (items) on a structured questionnaire may be aggregated into a composite scale or 
index for statistical analysis.  Questions should b e designed such that respondents are able to 
read, understand, and respond to them in a meaningful way, and hence the survey method may 
not be appropriate or practical for certain demographic groups such as children or the illiterate.   
 Most questionnaire  surveys tend to be self-administered mail surveys , where the 
same questionnaire is mailed to a large number of people, and willing respondents can 
complete the survey at their convenience and return it in postage -prepaid envelopes.  Mail 
surveys are advan tageous in that they are unobtrusive, and they are inexpensive to administer, 
since bulk postage is cheap in most countries.  However, response rates from mail surveys tend 
to be quite low since most people tend to ignore survey requests.  There may also b e long 
delays (several months) in respondents’ completing and returning the survey (or they may 
simply lose it).  Hence, the researcher must continuously monitor responses as they are being 
returned, track and send reminders to non -respondents repeated rem inders (two or three 
reminders at intervals of one to 1.5 months is ideal).  Questionnaire surveys are also not well -
suited for issues that require clarification on the part of the respondent or those that require 
detailed written responses.  Longitudinal designs can be used to survey the same set of 
respondents at different times, but response rates tend to fall precipitously from one survey to 
the next.   
 A second type of survey is group -administered  questionnaire .  A sample of 
respondents is brought tog ether at a common place and time, and each respondent is asked to 
complete the survey questionnaire while in that room.  Respondents enter their responses 
independently without interacting with each other.  This format is convenient for the 
researcher, and  high response rate is assured.  If respondents do not understand any specific 
question, they can ask for clarification.  In many organizations, it is relatively easy to assemble a 
group of employees in a conference room or lunch room, especially if the su rvey is approved by 
corporate executives.  
A more recent type of questionnaire survey is an online or web survey.  These surveys 
are administered over the Internet using interactive forms.  Respondents may receive an 
electronic mail request for participati on in the survey with a link to an online website where the 
survey may be completed.  Alternatively, the survey may be embedded into an e -mail, and can 
S u r v e y  R e s e a r c h  | 75 
 
 
 be completed and returned via e -mail.  These surveys are very inexpensive to administer, 
results are ins tantly recorded in an online database, and the survey can be easily modified if 
needed.  However, if the survey website is not password -protected or designed to prevent 
multiple submissions, the responses can be easily compromised.  Furthermore, sampling b ias 
may be a significant issue since the survey cannot reach people that do not have computer or 
Internet access, such as many of the poor, senior, and minority groups, and the respondent 
sample is skewed toward an younger demographic who are online much o f the time and have 
the time and ability to complete such surveys.  Computing the response rate may be 
problematic, if the survey link is posted on listservs or bulletin boards instead of being e -mailed 
directly to targeted respondents.  For these reasons,  many researchers prefer dual -media 
surveys (e.g., mail survey and online survey), allowing respondents to select their preferred 
method of response.  
Constructing a survey questionnaire is an art.  Numerous decisions must be made about 
the content of quest ions, their wording, format, and sequencing, all of which can have important 
consequences for the survey responses.   
Response formats.   Survey questions may be structured or unstructured.  Responses to 
structured questions are captured using one of the following response formats:  
 Dichotomous response , where respondents are asked to select one of two possible 
choices, such as true/false, yes/no, or agree/disagree.  An example of such a question is: 
Do you think that the death penalty is justif ied under some circumstances (circle one): 
yes / no.  
 Nominal response , where respondents are presented with more than two unordered 
options, such as: What is your industry of employment: manufacturing / consumer 
services / retail / education / healthcare /  tourism & hospitality / other.  
 Ordinal response , where respondents have more than two ordered options, such as: 
what is your highest level of education: high school / college degree / graduate studies.   
 Interval -level response , where respondents are pres ented with a 5 -point or 7 -point 
Likert scale, semantic differential scale, or Guttman scale.  Each of these scale types 
were discussed in a previous chapter.  
 Continuous response , where respondents enter a continuous (ratio -scaled) value with a 
meaningful z ero point, such as their age or tenure in a firm.  These responses generally 
tend to be of the fill -in-the blanks type.  
Question content and wording.  Responses obtained in survey research are very 
sensitive to the types of questions asked.  Poorly framed or ambiguous questions will likely 
result in meaningless responses with very little value.  Dillman (1978) recommends several 
rules for creating good survey questions.  Every single question in a survey should be carefully 
scrutinized for the following iss ues:  
 Is the question clear and understandable:   Survey questions should be stated in a very 
simple language, preferably in active voice,  and without complicated words or jargon 
that may not be understood by a typical respondent.  All questions in the quest ionnaire 
should be worded in a similar manner to make it easy for respondents to read and 
understand them.  The only exception is if your survey is targeted at a specialized group 
76 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 of respondents, such as doctors, lawyers and researchers, who use such jargo n in their 
everyday environment.   
 Is the question worded in a negative manner:  Negatively worded questions, such as 
should your local government not raise taxes, tend to confuse many responses and lead 
to inaccurate responses.  Such questions should be avoided, and in all cases, avoid 
double -negatives.  
 Is the question ambiguous:  Survey questions should not words or expressions that may 
be interpreted differently by different respondents (e.g., words like “any” or “just”) .  For 
instance, if you ask a respondent, what is your annual income, it is unclear whether you 
referring to salar y/wages, or also dividend, rental, and other income, whether you 
referring to personal income, family income (including spouse’s wages), or personal and 
business income?  Different interpretation by different respondents will lead to 
incomparable responses  that cannot be interpreted correctly.   
 Does the question have biased or value -laden words:   Bias refers to any property of a 
question that encourages subjects to answer in a certain way.  Kenneth Rasinky (1989) 
examined several studies on people’s attitu de toward government spending, and 
observed that respondents tend to indicate stronger support for “assistance to the poor” 
and less for “welfare”, even though both terms had the same meaning.  In this study, 
more support was also observed for “halting ris ing crime rate” (and less for “law 
enforcement”), “solving problems of big cities” (and less for “assistance to big cities”), 
and “dealing with drug addiction” (and less for “drug rehabilitation”).  A biased language 
or tone tends to skew observed response s.  It is often difficult to anticipate in advance 
the biasing wording, but to the greatest extent possible, survey questions should be 
carefully scrutinized to avoid biased language.  
 Is the question double -barreled :  Double -barreled questions are those th at can have 
multiple answers.  For example, are you satisfied with the hardware and software 
provided for your work?  In this example, how should a respondent answer if he/she is 
satisfied with the hardware but not with the software or vice versa?  It is a lways 
advisable to separate double -barreled questions into separate questions: (1) are you 
satisfied with the hardware provided for your work, and (2) are you satisfied with the 
software provided for your work.  Another example: does your family favor publ ic 
television?  Some people may favor public TV for themselves, but favor certain cable TV 
programs such as Sesame Street  for their children.   
 Is the question too general :  Sometimes, questions that are too general may not 
accurately convey respondents’ p erceptions.  If you asked someone how they liked a 
certain book and provide a response scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely well”, 
if that person selected “extremely well”, what does he/she mean?  Instead, ask more 
specific behavioral questions, s uch as will you recommend this book to others, or do you 
plan to read other books by the same author?  Likewise, instead of asking how big is 
your firm (which may be interpreted differently by respondents), ask how many people 
work for your firm, and/or wh at is the annual revenues of your firm, which are both 
measures of firm size.  
 Is the question too detailed :  Avoid unnecessarily detailed questions that serve no 
specific research purpose.  For instance, do you need the age of each child in a 
household or is just the number of children in the household acceptable?  However, if 
unsure, it is better to err on the side of details than generality.  
 Is the question presumptuous:   If you ask, what do you see are the benefits of a tax cut, 
you are presuming that th e respondent sees the tax cut as beneficial.  But many people 
may not view tax cuts as being beneficial, because tax cuts generally lead to lesser 
S u r v e y  R e s e a r c h  | 77 
 
 
 funding for public schools, larger class sizes, and fewer public services such as police, 
ambulance, and fire  service.  Avoid questions with built -in presumptions.  
 Is the question imaginary:   A popular question in many television game shows is “if you 
won a million dollars on this show, how will you plan to spend it?”  Most respondents 
have never been faced with such an amount of money and have never thought about it 
(most don’t even know that after taxes, they will get only about $640,000 or so in the 
United States, and in many cases, that amount is spread over a 20 -year period, so that 
their net present value is  even less), and so their answers tend to be quite random, such 
as take a tour around the world, buy a restaurant or bar, spend on education, save for 
retirement, help parents or children, or have a lavish wedding.  Imaginary questions 
have imaginary answe rs, which cannot be used for making scientific inferences.  
 Do respondents have the information needed to correctly answer the question:   Often 
times, we assume that subjects have the necessary information to answer a question, 
when in reality, they do not.   Even if a response is obtained, in such case, the responses 
tend to be inaccurate, given their lack of knowledge about the question being asked.  For 
instance, we should not ask the CEO of a company about day -to-day operational details 
that they may not be aware of, or asking teachers about how much their students are 
learning, or asking high -schoolers “Do you think the US Government acted appropriately 
in the Bay of Pigs crisis?”  
Question sequencing.   In general, questions should flow logically from one to the next. 
To achieve the best  response rates, questions should flow from the least sensitive to the most 
sensitive, from the factual and behavioral to the attitudinal, and from the more general to the 
more specific.  Some general rules for question sequ encing:  
 Start with easy non -threatening questions that can be easily recalled.  Good options are 
demographics (age, gender, education level) for individual -level surveys and 
firmographics (employee count, annual revenues, industry) for firm -level surveys.  
 Never start with an open ended question.  
 If following an historical sequence of events, follow a chronological order from earliest 
to latest.  
 Ask about one topic at a time.  When switching topics, use a transition, such as “The next 
section examines your opinions about …”  
 Use filter or contingency questions as needed, such as: “If you answered “yes” to 
question 5, please proceed to Section 2.  If you answered “no” go to Section 3.”  
Other golden rules .  Do unto your respondents what you would have them do u nto 
you.  Be attentive and appreciative of respondents’ time, attention, trust, and confidentiality of 
personal information.  Always practice the following strategies for all survey research:  
 People’s time is valuable.  Be respectful of their time.  Keep y our survey as short as 
possible and limit it to what is absolutely necessary.  Respondents do not like spending 
more than 10 -15 minutes on any survey, no matter how important it is.  Longer surveys 
tend to dramatically lower response rates.  
 Always assure r espondents about the confidentiality of their responses, and how you 
will use their data (e.g., for academic research) and how the results will be reported 
(usually, in the aggregate).  
 For organizational surveys, assure respondents that you will send them a copy of the 
final results, and make sure that you follow up with your promise.  
 Thank your respondents for their participation in your study . 
78 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
  Finally, always pretest your questionnaire, at least using a convenience sample, before 
administering it to respo ndents in a field setting.  Such pretesting may uncover 
ambiguity, lack of clarity, or biases in question wording, which should be eliminated 
before administering to the intended sample.  
Interview Survey  
Interviews are a more personalized form of data col lection method than questionnaires, 
and are conducted by trained interviewers using the same research protocol as questionnaire 
surveys (i.e., a standardized set of questions).  However, unlike a questionnaire, the interview 
script may contain special inst ructions for the interviewer that is not seen by respondents, and 
may include space for the interviewer to record personal observations and comments.  In 
addition, u nlike mail surveys, the interviewer has the opportunity to clarify any issues raised by 
the respondent or ask probing or follow -up questions.  However, interviews are time -
consuming and resource -intensive.  Special interviewing skills are needed on part of the 
interviewer.  The interviewer is also considered to be part of the measurement instrum ent, and 
must proactively strive not to artificially bias the observed responses.  
The most typical form of interview is personal or face -to-face interview , where the 
interviewer works directly with the respondent to ask questions and record their responses.  
Personal interviews may be conducted at the respondent’s home or office location.  This 
approach may even be favored by some respondents, while others may feel uncomfortable in 
allowing a stranger in their homes.  However, skilled interviewers can persuade respondents to 
cooperate, dramatically improving response rates.   
A variation of the personal interview is a group interview, also called focus group .  In 
this technique, a small group of respondents (usually 6 -10 respondents) are interviewed 
together in a common location.  The interviewer is essentially a facilitator whose job is to lead 
the discussion, and ensure that every person has an opportunity to respond.  Focus groups 
allow deeper examination of complex issues than other forms of survey research, because when 
people hear others talk, it often triggers responses or ideas that they did not think about before.  
However, focus group discussion may be dominated by a dominant personality, and some 
individuals may be reluctant to voice their opinions in front of their peers or superiors, 
especially while dealing with a sensitive issue such as employee underperformance or office 
politics.  Because of th eir small sample size, focus groups are usually used for exploratory 
research rather than descriptive or explanatory research.  
A third type of interview survey is telephone interviews .  In this technique, 
interviewers contact potential respondents over the  phone, typically based on a random 
selection of people from a telephone directory, to ask a standard set of survey questions.  A 
more recent and technologically advanced approach is computer -assisted telephone 
interviewing (CATI), increasing being used by  academic, government, and commercial survey 
researchers, where the interviewer is a telephone operator, who is guided through the 
interview process by a computer program displaying instructions and questions to be asked on 
a computer screen.  The system a lso selects respondents randomly using a random digit dialing 
S u r v e y  R e s e a r c h  | 79 
 
 
 technique, and records responses using voice capture technology.  Once respondents are on the 
phone, higher response rates can be obtained.  This technique is not ideal for rural areas where 
telephone density is low, and also cannot be used for communicating non -audio information 
such as graphics or product demonstrations.  
Role of interviewer.   The interviewer has a complex and multi -faceted role in the 
interview process, which includes the foll owing tasks:  
 Prepare for the interview:   Since the interviewer is in the forefront of the data collection 
effort, the quality of data collected depends heavily on how well the interviewer is 
trained to do the job.  The interviewer must be trained in the in terview process and the 
survey method, and also be familiar with the purpose of the study, how responses will 
be stored and used, and sources of interviewer bias.  He/she should also rehearse and 
time the interview prior to the formal study.  
 Locate and enl ist the cooperation of respondents:   Particularly in personal, in -home 
surveys, the interviewer must locate specific addresses, and work around respondents’ 
schedule sometimes at undesirable times such as during weekends.  They should also be 
like a salesp erson, selling the idea of participating in the study.  
 Motivate respondents:   Respondents often feed off the motivation of the interviewer.  If 
the interviewer is disinterested or inattentive, respondents won’t be motivated to 
provide useful or informative  responses either.  The interviewer must demonstrate 
enthusiasm about the study, communicate the importance of the research to 
respondents, and be attentive to respondents’ needs throughout the interview.  
 Clarify any confusion or concerns:  Interviewers must be able to think on their feet and 
address unanticipated concerns or objections raised by respondents to the respondents’ 
satisfaction.  Additionally, they should ask probing questions as necessary even if such 
questions are not in the script.  
 Observe  quality of response:   The interviewer is in the best position to judge the quality 
of information collected, and may supplement responses obtained using personal 
observations of gestures or body language as appropriate.  
Conducting the interview.  Before t he interview, the interviewer should prepare a kit 
to carry to the interview session, consisting of a cover letter from the principal investigator or 
sponsor, adequate copies of the survey instrument, photo identification, and a telephone 
number for respon dents to call to verify the interviewer’s authenticity.  The interviewer should 
also try to call respondents ahead of time to set up an appointment if possible.  To start the 
interview, he/she should speak in an imperative and confident tone, such as “I’d like to take a 
few minutes of your time to interview you for a very important study,” instead of “May I come in 
to do an interview?” He/she should introduce himself/herself, present personal credentials, 
explain the purpose of the study in 1 -2 sentences, a nd assure confidentiality of respondents’ 
comments and voluntariness of their participation, all in less than a minute.  No big words or 
jargon should be used, and no details should be provided unless specifically requested.  If the 
interviewer wishes to t ape-record the interview, he/she should ask for respondent’s explicit 
permission before doing so.  Even if the interview is recorded, the interview must take notes on 
key issues, probes, or verbatim phrases.   
During the interview, the interviewer should f ollow the questionnaire script and ask 
questions exactly as written, and not change the words to make the question sound friendlier.  
They should also not change the order of questions or skip any question that may have been 
80 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 answered earlier.  Any issues w ith the questions should be discussed during rehearsal prior to 
the actual interview sessions.  The interviewer should not finish the respondent’s sentences.  If 
the respondent gives a brief cursory answer, the interviewer should probe the respondent to 
elicit a more thoughtful, thorough response.  Some useful probing techniques are:  
 The silent probe:   Just pausing and waiting (without going into the next question) may 
suggest to respondents that the interviewer is waiting for more detailed response.  
 Overt  encouragement:   Occasional “uh -huh” or “okay” may encourage the respondent to 
go into greater details.  However, the interviewer must not express approval or 
disapproval of what was said by the respondent.  
 Ask for elaboration:   Such as “can you elaborate  on that?” or “A minute ago, you were 
talking about an experience you had in high school.  Can you tell me more about that?”  
 Reflection:  The interviewer can try the psychotherapist’s trick of repeating what the 
respondent said.  For instance, “What I’m he aring is that you found that experience very 
traumatic” and then pause and wait for the respondent to elaborate.  
After the interview in completed, the interviewer should thank respondents for their 
time, tell them when to expect the results, and not leave hastily.  Immediately after leaving, they 
should write down any notes or key observations that may help interpret the respondent’s 
comments better.  
Biases in Survey Research  
Despite all of its strengths and advantages, survey research is often tainted with  
systematic biases that may invalidate some of the inferences derived from such surveys.  Five 
such biases are the non -response bias, sampling bias, social desirability bias, recall bias, and 
common method bias.  
Non -response bias.   Survey research is generally notorious for its low response rates.  
A response rate of 15 -20% is typical in a mail survey, even after two or three reminders.  If the 
majority of the targeted respondents fail to respond to a survey, then a legitimate conc ern is 
whether non -respondents are not responding due to a systematic reason, which may raise 
questions about the validity of the study’s results.  For instance, dissatisfied customers tend to 
be more vocal about their experience than satisfied customers, and are therefore more likely to 
respond to questionnaire surveys or interview requests than satisfied customers.  Hence, any 
respondent sample is likely to have a higher proportion of dissatisfied customers than the 
underlying population from which it is drawn.  In this instance, not only will the results lack 
generalizability, but the observed outcomes may also be an artifact of the biased sample.  
Several strategies may be employed to improve response rates:  
 Advance notification:   A short letter sent in advance to the targeted respondents 
soliciting their participation in an upcoming survey can prepare them in advance and 
improve their propensity to respond.  The letter should state the purpose and 
importance of the study, mode of data collection (e.g., v ia a phone call, a survey form in 
the mail, etc.), and appreciation for their cooperation.  A variation of this technique may 
request the respondent to return a postage -paid postcard indicating whether or not 
they are willing to participate in the study.  
 Relevance of content:   If a survey examines issues of relevance or importance to 
respondents, then they are more likely to respond than to surveys that don’t matter to 
them.  
S u r v e y  R e s e a r c h  | 81 
 
 
  Respondent -friendly questionnaire:   Shorter survey questionnaires tend to elicit hi gher 
response rates than longer questionnaires.  Furthermore, questions that are clear, non -
offensive, and easy to respond tend to attract higher response rates.  
 Endorsement:   For organizational surveys, it helps to gain endorsement from a senior 
executive  attesting to the importance of the study to the organization.  Such 
endorsement can be in the form of a cover letter or a letter of introduction, which can 
improve the researcher’s credibility in the eyes of the respondents.  
 Follow -up requests:   Multiple follow -up requests may coax some non -respondents to 
respond, even if their responses are late.  
 Interviewer training:   Response rates for interviews can be improved with skilled 
interviewers trained on how to request interviews, use computerized dialing techniques 
to identify potential respondents, and schedule callbacks for respondents who could not 
be reached.  
 Incentiv es:  Response rates, at least with certain populations, may increase with the use 
of incentives in the form of cash or gift cards, giveaways such as pens or stress balls, 
entry into a lottery, draw or contest, discount coupons, promise of contribution to 
charity, and so forth.  
 Non -monetary incentives:   Businesses, in particular, are more prone to respond to non -
monetary incentives than financial incentives.  An example of such a non -monetary 
incentive is a benchmarking report comparing the business’s indiv idual response 
against the aggregate of all responses to a survey.  
 Confidentiality and privacy:   Finally, assurances that respondents’ private data or 
responses will not fall into the hands of any third party, may help improve response 
rates.  
Sampling bias .  Telephone surveys conducted by calling a random sample of publicly 
available telephone numbers will systematically exclude people with unlisted telephone 
numbers, mobile phone numbers, and people who are unable to answer the phone (for instance, 
they ar e at work) when the survey is being conducted, and will include a disproportionate 
number of respondents who have land -line telephone service with listed phone numbers and 
people who stay home during much of the day, such as the unemployed, the disabled, a nd the 
elderly.  Likewise, online surveys tend to include a disproportionate number of students and 
younger people who are constantly on the Internet, and systematically exclude people with 
limited or no access to computers or the Internet, such as the poo r and the elderly.  Similarly, 
questionnaire surveys tend to exclude children and the illiterate, who are unable to read, 
understand, or meaningfully respond to the questionnaire.  A different kind of sampling bias 
relate to sampling the wrong population, such as asking teachers (or parents) about academic 
learning of their students (or children), or asking CEOs about operational details in their 
company.  Such biases make the respondent sample unrepresentative of the intended 
population and hurt generaliza bility claims about inferences drawn from the biased sample.   
 Social desirability bias .  Many respondents tend to avoid negative opinions or 
embarrassing comments about themselves, their employers, family, or friends.  With negative 
questions such as do you think that your project team is dysfunctional, is there a lot of office 
politics in your workplace, or have you ever illegally downloaded music files from the Internet, 
the researcher may not get truthful responses.  This tendency among respondents to “spin the 
truth” in order to portray themselves in a socially desirable manner is called the “social 
desirability bias”, which hurts the validity of response obtained from survey research.  There is 
practically no way of overcoming the social desirability bias in a questionnaire survey, but in an 
82 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 interview setting, an astute interviewer may be able to spot inconsistent answers and ask 
probing questions or use personal observations to supplement respondents’ comments.  
 Recall bias.   Responses to survey quest ions often depend on subjects’ motivation, 
memory, and ability to respond. Particularly when dealing with events that happened in the 
distant past, respondents may not adequately remember their own motivations or behaviors or 
perhaps their memory of such e vents may have evolved with time and no longer retrievable.  
For instance, if a respondent to asked to describe his/her utilization of computer technology 
one year ago or even memorable childhood events like birthdays, their response may not be 
accurate du e to difficulties with recall.  One possible way of overcoming the recall bias is by 
anchoring respondent’s memory in specific events as they happened, rather than asking them 
to recall their perceptions and motivations from memory.  
  Common method bias.   Common method bias refers to the amount of spurious 
covariance shared between independent and dependent variables that are measured at the 
same point in time, such as in a cross -sectional survey, using the same instrument, such as a 
questionnaire.  In such  cases, the phenomenon under investigation may not be adequately 
separated from measurement artifacts.  Standard statistical tests are available to test for 
common method bias, such as Harmon’s single -factor test (Podsakoff et al. 2003), Lindell and 
Whitne y’s (2001) market variable technique, and so forth.  This bias can be potentially avoided 
if the independent and dependent variables are measured at different points in time, using a 
longitudinal survey design, of if these variables are measured using diff erent methods, such as 
computerized recording of dependent variable versus questionnaire -based self -rating of 
independent variables.

Experimental Research  
 
 
 Experimental research, often considered to be the “gold standard” in research designs, 
is one of the most rigorous of all research designs.  In this design, one or more independent 
variables are manipulated by the researcher (as treatments), subjects are r andomly assigned to 
different treatment levels (random assignment), and the results of the treatments on outcomes 
(dependent variables) are observed.  The unique strength of experimental research is its 
internal validity  (causality) due to its ability to l ink cause and effect through treatment 
manipulation, while controlling for the spurious effect of extraneous variable.   
 Experimental research is best suited for explanatory research (rather than for 
descriptive or exploratory research), where the goal of  the study is to examine cause -effect 
relationships.  It also works well for research that involves a relatively limited and well -defined 
set of independent variables that can either be manipulated or controlled.  Experimental 
research can be conducted in laboratory or field settings.  Laboratory experiments , conducted 
in laboratory (artificial) settings, tend to be high in internal validity, but this comes at the cost 
of low external validity  (generalizability), because the artificial (laboratory) setting in which 
the study is conducted may not reflect the real world.  Field experiments , conducted in field 
settings such as in a real organization, and high in both internal and external validity.  But such 
experiments are relatively rare, because of the difficulties associated with manipulating 
treatments and controlling for extraneous effects in a field setting.  
Experimental research can be grouped into two broad categories: true experimental 
designs and quasi -experimental designs.  Both designs require treatment manipulation, but 
while true experiments also require random assignment, quasi -experiments do not.  
Sometimes, we also refer to non -experimental research, which is not really a research design, 
but an all -inclusive term that includes all types of  research that do not employ treatment 
manipulation or random assignment, such as survey research, observational research, and 
correlational studies.   
Basic Concepts  
Treatment and control groups.   In experimental research, some subjects are 
administered o ne or more experimental stimulus called a treatment  (the treatment group ) 
while other subjects are not given such a stimulus (the control group ).  The treatment may be 
considered successful if subjects in the treatment group rate more favorably on outcome 
variables than control group subjects.  Multiple levels of experimental stimulus may be 
administered, in which case, there may be more than one treatment group.  For example, in 
84 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 order to test the effects of a new drug intended to treat a certain medical co ndition like 
dementia, if a sample of dementia patients is randomly divided into three groups, with the first 
group receiving a high dosage of the drug, the second group receiving a low dosage, and the 
third group receives a placebo such as a sugar pill (c ontrol group), then the first two groups are 
experimental groups and the third group is a control group.  After administering the drug for a 
period of time, if the condition of the experimental group subjects improved significantly more 
than the control gr oup subjects, we can say that the drug is effective.  We can also compare the 
conditions of the high and low dosage experimental groups to determine if the high dose is 
more effective than the low dose.   
Treatment manipulation.   Treatments are the unique feature of experimental research 
that sets this design apart from all other research methods.  Treatment manipulation helps 
control for the “cause” in cause -effect relationships.  Naturally, the validity of experimental 
research depends on how well the tre atment was manipulated.  Treatment manipulation must 
be checked using pretests and pilot tests prior to the experimental study.  Any measurements 
conducted before the treatment is administered are called pretest measures , while those 
conducted after the tr eatment are posttest measures . 
Random selection and assignment.   Random selection is the process of randomly 
drawing a sample from a population or a sampling frame.  This approach is typically employed 
in survey research, and assures that each unit in the population has a positive chance of being 
selected into the sample.  Random assignment is however a process of randomly assigning 
subjects to experimental or control groups.  This is a standard practice in true experimental 
research to ensure that treatmen t groups are similar (equivalent) to each other and to the 
control group, prior to treatment administration.  Random selection is related to sampling, and 
is therefore, more closely related to the external validity (generalizability) of findings.  
However,  random assignment is related to design, and is therefore most related to internal 
validity.  It is possible to have both random selection and random assignment in well -designed 
experimental research, but quasi -experimental research involves neither random  selection nor 
random assignment.   
Threats to internal validity.   Although experimental designs are considered more 
rigorous than other research methods in terms of the internal validity of their inferences (by 
virtue of their ability to control causes th rough treatment manipulation), they are not immune 
to internal validity threats.  Some of these threats to internal validity are described below, 
within the context of a study of the impact of a special remedial math tutoring program for 
improving the math  abilities of high school students.  
 History threat is the possibility that  the observed effects (dependent variables) are 
caused by extraneous or historical events rather than by the experimental treatment.  
For instance, students’ post -remedial math score  improvement may have been caused 
by their preparation for a math exam at their school, rather than the remedial math 
program.  
 Maturation threat refers to the possibility that observed effects are caused by natural 
maturation of subjects (e.g., a general i mprovement in their intellectual ability to 
understand complex concepts) rather than the experimental treatment.  
 Testing threat is a threat in pre -post designs where subjects’ posttest responses are 
conditioned by their pretest responses.  For instance, if  students remember their 
answers from the pretest evaluation, they may tend to repeat them in the posttest exam.  
Not conducting a pretest can help avoid this threat.  
E x p e r i m e n t a l  R e s e a r c h  | 85 
 
 
  Instrumentation threat , which also occurs in pre -post designs, refers to the possibility 
that the difference between pretest and posttest scores is not due to the remedial math 
program, but due to changes in the administered test, such as the posttest having a 
higher or lower degree of difficulty than the pretest.  
 Mortality threat  refers to th e possibility that subjects may be dropping out of the study 
at differential rates between the treatment and control groups due to a systematic 
reason , such that the dropouts were mostly students who scored low on the pretest.  If 
the low -performing studen ts drop out, the results of the posttest will be artificially 
inflated by the preponderance of high -performing students.  
 Regression threat , also called a regression to the mean, refers to the statistical tendency 
of a group’s overall performance on a measure during a posttest to regress toward the 
mean of that measure rather than in the anticipated direction.  For instance, if subjects 
score d high on a pretest, they will have a tendency to score lower on the posttest (closer 
to the mean) because their high scores (away from the mean) during the pretest was 
possibly a statistical aberration.  This problem tends to be more prevalent in non -
rand om samples and when the two measures are imperfectly correlated.   
Two -Group Experimental Designs  
 The simplest true experimental designs are two group designs involving one treatment 
group and one control group, and are ideally suited for testing the effe cts of a single 
independent variable that can be manipulated as a treatment.  The two basic two -group designs 
are the pretest -posttest control group design and the posttest -only control group design, while 
variations may include covariance designs.  These designs are often depicted using a 
standardized design notation, where R represents random assignment of subjects to groups, X 
represents the treatment administered to the treatment group, and O represents pretest or 
posttest observations of the dependent variable (with different subscripts to distinguish 
between pretest and posttest observations of treatment and control groups).  
Pretest -posttest control group design .  In this design, subjects are randomly assigned 
to treatment and control groups, subjected  to an initial (pretest) measurement of the 
dependent variables of interest, the treatment group is administered a treatment (representing 
the independent variable of interest), and the dependent variables measured again (posttest).  
The notation of this d esign is shown in Figure 10.1.   
 
Figure 10 .1. Pretest -posttest control group design  
 
The effect E of the experimental treatment in the pretest posttest design is measured as 
the difference in the posttest and pretest scores between the treatment and control groups:  
E = (O 2 – O1) – (O4 – O3) 
Statistical analysis of this design involves a simple analys is of variance (ANOVA) 
between the treatment and control groups.  The pretest posttest design handles several threats 
to internal validity, such as maturation, testing, and regression, since these threats can be 
expected to influence both treatment and con trol groups in a similar (random) manner.  The 

86 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 selection threat is controlled via random assignment.  However, additional threats to internal 
validity may exist.  For instance, mortality can be a problem if there are differential dropout 
rates between the two groups, and the pretest measurement may bias the posttest 
measurement (especially if the pretest introduces unusual topics or content).  
Posttest -only control group design .  This design is a simpler version of the pretest -
posttest design where pretest m easurements are omitted.   The desi gn notation is shown in 
Figure 10 .2. 
 
Figure 10 .2. Posttest only control group design  
 
The treatment effect is measured simply as the difference in the posttest scores 
between the two groups:  
E = (O 1 – O2)  
The appropriate statistical analysis of this design is also a two -group analysis of 
variance (ANOVA).  The simplicity of this design makes it more attractive than the pretest -
posttest design in terms of internal validity.  This design controls for maturati on, testing, 
regression, selection, and pretest -posttest interaction, though the mortality threat may continue 
to exist.   
Covariance designs .  Sometimes, measures of dependent variables may be influenced 
by extraneous variables called covariates .  Covaria tes are those variables that are not of central 
interest to an experimental study, but should nevertheless be controlled in an experimental 
design in order to eliminate their potential effect on the dependent variable and therefore allow 
for a more accurat e detection of the effects of the independent variables of interest.  The 
experimental designs discussed earlier did not control for such covariates.  A covariance design 
(also called a concomitant variable design) is a special type of pretest posttest con trol group 
design where the pretest measure is essentially a measurement of the covariates of interest 
rather than that of the dependent variables.  The design notation is shown in Figure 10.3, where 
C represents the covariates:  
 
Figure 10.3. Covariance d esign  
 
Because the pretest measure is not a measurement of the dependent variable, but rather 
a covariate, the treatment effect is measured as the difference in the posttest scores between 
the treatment and control groups as:  
E = (O 1 – O2)  
Due to the pre sence of covariates, the right statistical analysis of this design is a two -
group analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  This design has all the advantages of post -test only 

E x p e r i m e n t a l  R e s e a r c h  | 87 
 
 
 design, but with internal validity due to the controlling of covariates.  Covariance de signs can 
also be extended to pretest -posttest control group design.  
Factorial Designs  
Two -group designs are inadequate if your research requires manipulation of two or 
more independent variables (treatments).  In such cases, you would need four or higher -group 
designs. Such designs, quite popular in experimental research, are commonly called factorial 
designs.  Each independent variable in this design is called a factor , and each sub -division of a 
factor is called a level .  Factorial designs enable the res earcher to examine not only the 
individual effect of each treatment on the dependent variables (called main effects), but also 
their joint effect (called interaction effects).  
The most basic factorial design is a 2 x 2 factorial design, which consists of two 
treatments, each with two levels (such as high/low or present/absent).  For instance, let’s say 
that you want to compare the learning outcomes of two different types of instructional 
techniques (in -class and online instruction), and you also want to ex amine whether these 
effects vary with the time of instruction (1.5 or 3 hours per week).  In this case, you have two 
factors: instructional type and instructional time; each with two levels (in -class and online for 
instructional type, and 1.5 and 3 hours/w eek for instructional time), as shown in Figure 8.1.  If 
you wish to add a third level of instructional time (say 6 hours/week), then the second factor 
will consist of three levels and you will have a 2 x 3 factorial design.  On the other hand, if you 
wish  to add a third factor such as group work (present versus absent), you will have a 2 x 2 x 2 
factorial design.  In this notation, each number represents a factor, and the value of each factor 
represents the number of levels in that factor.  
 
Figure 10.4.  2 x 2 factorial design  
 
Factorial designs can also be depicted using a design notation, such as that show n on the 
right panel of Figure 10 .4.  R represents random assignment of subjects to treatment groups, X 
represents the treatment groups themselves (the  subscripts of X represents the level of each 
factor), and O represent observations of the dependent variable.  Notice that the 2 x 2 factorial 
design will have four treatment groups, corresponding to the four combinations of the two 
levels of each factor.   Correspondingly, the 2 x 3 design will have six treatment groups, and the 2 
x 2 x 2 design will have eight treatment groups.  As a rule of thumb, each cell in a factorial 
design should have a minimum sample size of 20 (this estimate is derived from Cohen ’s power 
calculations based on medium effect sizes).  So a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design requires a minimum 
total sample size of 160 subjects, with at least 20 subjects in each cell.  As you can see, the cost 

88 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 of data collection can increase substantially with  more levels or factors in your factorial design.  
Sometimes, due to resource constraints, some cells in such factorial designs may not receive any 
treatment at all, which are called incomplete factorial designs .  Such incomplete designs hurt our 
ability t o draw inferences about the incomplete factors.  
In a factorial design, a main effect  is said to exist if the dependent variable shows a 
significant difference between multiple levels of one factor, at all levels  of other factors.  No 
change in the dependen t variable across factor levels is the null case (baseline), from which 
main effects are evaluated.  In the above example, you may see a main effect of instructional 
type, instructional time, or both on learning outcomes.  An interaction effect  exists when  the 
effect of differences in one factor depends upon the level of a second factor.  In our example, if 
the effect of instructional type on learning outcomes is greater for 3 hours/week of 
instructional time than for 1.5 hours/week, then we can say that th ere is an interaction effect 
between instructional type and instructional time on learning outcomes.  Note that the presence 
of interaction effects dominate and make main effects irrelevant, and it is not meaningful to 
interpret main effects if interaction  effects are significant.  
Hybrid Experimental Designs  
 Hybrid designs are those that are formed by combining features of more established 
designs.  Three such hybrid designs are randomized bocks design, Solomon four -group design, 
and switched replications design.  
 Randomized block design.   This is a variation of the posttest -only or pretest -posttest 
control group design where the subject population can be grouped into relatively homogeneous 
subgroups (called blocks ) within which the experiment is replicated .  For instance, if you want 
to replicate the same posttest -only design among university students and full -time working 
professionals (two homogeneous blocks), subjects in both blocks are randomly split between 
treatment group (receiving the same treatment ) or control group (see Figure 10 .5).  The 
purpose of this design is to reduce the “noise” or variance in data that may be attributable to 
differences between the blocks so that the actual effect of interest can be detected more 
accurately.   
 
 Figure 10 .5.  Randomized blocks design  
 
Solomon four -group design .  In this design, the sample is divided into two treatment 
groups and two control groups.  One treatment group and one control group receive the pretest, 
and the other two groups do not.  This design represents a combination of posttest -only and 
pretest -posttest control group design, and is intended to test for the potential biasing effect of 
pretest measurement on posttest measures that tends to occur in pretest -posttest designs but 
not in posttest on ly designs.  The desi gn notation is shown in Figure 10 .6. 

E x p e r i m e n t a l  R e s e a r c h  | 89 
 
 
  
Figure 10 .6.  Solomon four -group design  
 
 Switched replication design .  This is a two -group design implemented in two phases 
with three waves of measurement.  The treatment group in the first phas e serves as the control 
group in the second phase, and the control group in the first phase becomes the treatment 
group in the second p hase, as illustrated in Figure 10 .7.  In other words, the original design is 
repeated or replicated temporally with treat ment/control roles switched between the two 
groups.  By the end of the study, all participants will have received the treatment either during 
the first or the second phase.  This design is most feasible in organizational contexts where 
organizational progr ams (e.g., employee training) are implemented in a phased manner or are 
repeated at regular intervals.    
 
Figure 10 .7.  Switched replication design  
 
 
Quasi -Experimental Designs  
Quasi -experimental designs are almost identical to true experimental designs,  but 
lacking one key ingredient: random assignment.  For instance, one entire class section or one 
organization is used as the treatment group, while another section of the same class or a 
different organization in the same industry is used as the control group.  This lack of random 
assignment potentially results in groups  that are non -equivalent, such as one group possessing 
greater mastery of a certain content than the other group, say by virtue of having a better 
teacher in a previous semester, which in troduces the possibility of selection bias .  Quasi -
experimental designs are therefore inferior to true experimental designs in interval validity due 
to the presence of a variety of selection related threats such as selection -maturation threat (the 
treatment and control groups maturing at different rates), selection -history threat (the 
treatment and control groups being differentially impact by extraneous or historical events), 
selection -regression threat (the treatment and control groups regressing toward the mean 
between pretest and posttest at different rates), selection -instrumentation threat (the 
treatment and control groups responding differently to the measurement), selection -testing 
(the treatment and control groups responding differently to t he pretest), and selection -
mortality (the treatment and control groups demonstrating differential dropout rates). Given 
these selection threats, it is generally preferable to avoid quasi -experimental designs to the 
greatest extent possible.  
Many true exper imental designs can be converted to quasi -experimental designs by 
omitting random assignment.  For instance, the quasi -equivalent version of pretest -posttest 
control group design is called nonequivalent groups design (NEGD), as shown in Figure 10 .8, 
with r andom assignment R replaced by non -equivalent (non -random) assignment N.  Likewise, 

90 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 the quasi -experimental version of switched replication design is called non -equivalent 
switched replication design  (see Figure 10.9). 
  
Figure 10 .8.  NEGD design  
 
 
Figur e 10.9.  Non -equivalent switched replication  design  
 
In addition, there are quite a few unique non -equivalent designs without corresponding 
true experimental design cousins.  Some of the more useful of these designs are discussed next.  
Regression -discontinu ity (RD) design . This is a non -equivalent pretest -posttest 
design where subjects are assigned to treatment or control group based on a cutoff score on a 
preprogram measure.  For instance, patients who are severely ill may be assigned to a 
treatment group t o test the efficacy of a new drug or treatment protocol and those who are 
mildly ill are assigned to the control group.  In another example, students who are lagging 
behind on standardized test scores may be selected for a remedial curriculum program 
inten ded to improve their performance, while those who score high on such tests are not 
selected from the remedial program.  The design notation can be represented as follows, where 
C represents the cutoff score:  
 
Figure 10 .10.  RD design  
 
Because of the use o f a cutoff score, it is possible that the observed results may be a 
function of the cutoff score rather than the treatment, which introduces a new threat to internal 
validity.  However, using the cutoff score also ensures that limited or costly resources a re 
distributed to people who need them the most rather than randomly across a population, while 
simultaneously allowing a quasi -experimental treatment.  The control group scores in the RD 
design does not serve as a benchmark for comparing treatment group s cores, given the 
systematic non -equivalence between the two groups.  Rather, if there is no discontinuity 
between pretest and posttest scores in the control group, but such a discontinuity persists in 
the treatment group, then this discontinuity is viewed as evidence of the treatment effect.   
Proxy pretest design .  This design, shown in Figure 10 .11, looks very similar to the 
standard NEGD (pretest -posttest) design, with one critical difference: the pretest score is 
collected after the treatment is adminis tered.  A typical application of this design is when a 
researcher is brought in to test the efficacy of a program (e.g., an educational program) after the 
program has already started and pretest data is not available.  Under such circumstances, the 
best op tion for the researcher is often to use a different prerecorded measure, such as students’ 

E x p e r i m e n t a l  R e s e a r c h  | 91 
 
 
 grade point average before the start of the program, as a proxy for pretest data.  A variation of 
the proxy pretest design is to use subjects’ posttest recollection of pretest data, which may be 
subject to recall bias, but nevertheless may provide a measure of perceived  gain or change in the 
dependent variable.  
 
Figure 10.11.  Proxy pretest design  
 
Separate pretest -posttest samples design .  This design is useful if it is not possible to 
collect pretest and posttest data from the same subjects for so me reason.  As shown in Figure 
10.12, there are four groups in this design, but two groups come from a single non -equivalent 
group, while the other two groups come from a different non -equivalent group.  For instance, 
you want to test customer satisfaction with a new online service that is implemented in one city 
but not in another.  In this case, customers in the first city serve  as the treatment group and 
those in the sec ond city constitute the control group.  If it is not possible to obtain pretest and 
posttest measure s from the same customers , you can measure customer satisfaction at one 
point in time, implement the new service program, and measure customer satisfaction (with a 
different set of customers) after the program is implemented.  Customer satisfaction is also 
measured in the control group at the same times as in the treatment group, but without the new 
program implementation.  The design is not particularly stro ng, because you cannot examine 
the changes in any specific customer’s satisfaction score before and after the implementation, 
but you can only examine average  customer satisfaction scores.  Despite the lower internal 
validity, this design may still be a us eful way of collecting quasi -experimental data when pre test 
and posttest data are not available  from the same subjects . 
 
 Figure 10.12.  Separate pretest -posttest samples design  
 
Nonequivalent dependent variable (NEDV) design .  This is a single -group pre-post 
quasi -experimental design with two outcome measures, where one measure is theoretically 
expected to be influenced by the treatment and the other measure is not.  For instance, if you 
are designing a new calculus curriculum for high school students , this curriculum is likely to 
influence students’ posttest calculus scores but not algebra scores.  However, the posttest 
algebra scores may still vary due to extraneous factors such as history or maturation.  Hence, 
the pre -post algebra scores can be use d as a control measure, while that of pre -post calculus can 
be treated as the treatment measure.  The de sign notation, shown in Figure 10 .13, indicates the 
single group by a single N, followed by pretest O1 and posttest O2 for calculus and algebra for the 
same group of students.  This design is weak in internal validity, but its advantage lies in not 
having to use a separate control group.   
An interesting variation of the NEDV design is a pattern matching NEDV design , which 
employs multiple outcome variabl es and a theory that explains how much each variable will be 

92 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 affected by the treatment.  The researcher can then examine if the theoretical prediction is 
matched in actual observations.  This pattern -matching technique, based on the degree of 
correspondenc e between theoretical and observed patterns is a powerful way of alleviating 
internal validity concerns in the original NEDV design.

Perils of Experimental Research  
Experimental research is one of the most difficult of research designs, and should not be 
taken lightly.  This type of research is often best with a multitude of methodological problems.  
First, though experimental research requires theories for framing hy potheses for testing, much 
of current experimental research is atheoretical.  Without theories, the hypotheses being tested 
tend to be ad hoc, possibly illogical, and meaningless.  Second, many of the measurement 
instruments used in experimental research a re not tested for reliability and validity, and are 
incomparable across studies.  Consequently, results generated using such instruments are also 
incomparable.  Third, many experimental research use inappropriate research designs, such as 
irrelevant depend ent variables, no interaction effects, no experimental controls, and non -
equivalent stimulus across treatment groups.  Findings from such studies tend to lack internal 
validity and are highly suspect.  Fourth, the treatments (tasks) used in experimental re search 
may be diverse, incomparable, and inconsistent across studies and sometimes inappropriate for 
the subject population.  For instance, undergraduate student subjects are often asked to 
pretend that they are marketing managers and asked to perform a co mplex budget allocation 
task in which they have no experience or expertise.  The use of such inappropriate tasks, 
introduces new threats to internal validity (i.e., subject’s performance may be an artifact of the 
content or difficulty of the task setting),  generates findings that are non -interpretable and 
meaningless, and makes integration of findings across studies impossible.   
The design of proper experimental treatments is a very important task in experimental 
design, because the treatment is the raison  d’etre  of the experimental method, and must never 
be rushed or neglected.  To design an adequate and appropriate task, researchers should use 
prevalidated tasks if available, conduct treatment manipulation checks to check for the 
adequacy of such tasks (b y debriefing subjects after performing the assigned task), conduct 
pilot tests (repeatedly, if necessary), and if doubt, using tasks that are simpler and familiar for 
the respondent sample than tasks that are complex or unfamiliar.  
In summary, this chapter  introduced key concepts in the experimental design research 
method and introduced a variety of true experimental and quasi -experimental designs.  
Although these designs vary widely in internal validity, designs with less internal validity 
should not be ov erlooked and may sometimes be useful under specific circumstances and 
empirical contingencies.

Case Research  
 
 
Case research , also called case study,  is a method  of intensively studying a phenomenon  
over time within its natura l setting in one or a few sites.  Multiple methods of data collection, 
such as interviews, observations, prerecorded documents, and secondary data , may be 
employed and inferences about  the ph enomenon of interest  tend to be rich, detailed, and 
contextualized.  Case research can be employed in a positivist manner for the purpose of theory 
testing or in an interpretive manner for theory building.  This method is more popular in 
business research than in other social science disciplines.   
Case research has several unique strengths over competing research methods such as 
experiments and survey research.  First, case research can be used for either theory building or 
theory testing , while positivist  methods can be used for theory testing only .  In interpretive case 
research, the constructs of interest need not be known in advance, but may emerge from the 
data as the research  progresses .  Second, the research questions can be modified during the 
research process if the original questions are found to be less relevant or salient.  This is not 
possible in any positivist  method after the data  is collected .  Third, case research can help 
derive richer, more contextualized, and more authentic interpretation of the phenomenon of 
interest than most other research method s by virtue of its ability to capture a rich array of 
contextual data.  Fourth, the phenomenon of interest can be studied from t he perspec tives of 
multiple participants  and using  multiple levels of analysis (e.g., individual and organizational).  
At the same time, case research also has some inherent weaknesses.  Because it involves 
no experimental control, internal validity of inf erences remain weak.  Of course, t his is a 
common problem for all resea rch methods except experiments.  However, as described later , 
the problem of controls may be addressed in case research using “natural controls”.  Second, the 
quality of inferences deri ved from case research depends heavily on the integrative powers of 
the researcher.  An experienced researcher may see concepts and patterns in case data that a 
novice researcher may miss.  Hence, the findings are sometimes criticized as being subjective.  
Finally, because the inferences are heavily contextualized, it may be difficult to generalize 
inferences from case research to other contexts or other organizations.  
It is important to recognize that case research is different from case descriptions  such as 
Harvard case stu dies  discussed in business classes .  While case descriptions typically describe 
an organizational problem in rich detail with the goal of s timulating classroom discussion and 
critical thinking among students , or analyzing how well an organization  handle d a specific 
problem , case research is a formal research technique that involves a scientific method to 
derive explanations of organizational phenomena .

 Case research is a difficult research method  that requires  advanced research skills on 
the part of the researcher, and is therefore, often prone to error.  Benbasat et al. (1987)8 
describe  five problems frequently encountered in case research studies.  First, many case 
research studies start without specific rese arch questions, and therefore end up without having 
any specific answers or insightful inferences.  Second, case sites are often chosen based on 
access and convenience, rather than based on the fit with the research questions, and are 
therefore cannot  adeq uately address the research questions of interest.  Third, researchers 
often do not validate or triangulate data collected using multiple means, which may lead to 
biased interpretation based on responses from biased interviewee s.  Fourth, many studies 
prov ide very little details on how data was collected (e.g., what interview questions were used, 
which documents were examined, what are the organizational positions of each interviewee, 
etc.)  or analyzed , which may raise doubts about the reliability of  the in ferences .  Finally, despite 
its strength as a longitudinal research method, many case research studies do not follow 
through a phenomenon in a longitudinal manner, and hence present only a cross -sectional and 
limited view of organizational processes and ph enomena  that are temporal in nature . 
Key Decisions in Case Research  
 Several key decisions must be made by a researcher when considering a case research 
method.  First, is this the right method for the research questions being studied?  The case 
research method is particularly appropriate for exploratory studies for discovering relevant 
constructs in areas where theory building at the formative stages, for studies where the 
experiences of participants  and context of actions are critical, and for studies aimed at 
understanding complex, temporal processes (why and how of a phenomenon) rather than 
factors or causes (what) .  This method is well -suited for studying complex organizational 
processes  that involve  multiple participants  and interact ing sequences of events , such as 
organizational change and large -scale technology implementation  projects . 
 Second, what is the appropriate unit of analysis for a case research study?  Since  case 
research can simultaneously examine multipl e units of analys es, the researcher must decide 
whether she wishes to study a phenomenon at the individual, group, and organizational level or 
at multiple level s.  For instance, a study of group decision making or group work may combine 
individual -level constructs such as indi vidual participation in group activities  with group -level 
constructs, such as group cohesion and group leadership, to derive rich er understanding than 
that can be achieved from a single level of analysis.  
Third, should the researcher employ a single -case or multiple -case design?  The single 
case design is more appropriate at the outset of theory generation, if the situation is unique or 
extreme, if it is revelatory (i.e., the situation was previously inaccessible for scientific 
investigation), or if it represents a critical or contrary case for testing a well -formulated theory.  
The multiple case design is more appropriate for theory testing, for establishing generalizability 
of inferences , and for developing richer and more nuanced interpretation s of a phenomenon.  
Yin (1984)9 recommends the use of multiple case sites with replication logic, viewing each case 
site as similar to one experimental study, and following rules of scientific rigor similar to that 
used in positivist research .

  Fourth, what sit es should be chosen for case research?  Given the contextualized nature 
of inferences derived from case research, site selection is a particularly critical issue because 
selecting the wrong site may lead to the wrong inferences.  If the goal of the researc h is to test 
theories  or examine generalizability of inferences, then dissimilar case sites should be selected 
to increase variance in observations.  For instance, if the goal of the research is to understand 
the process of technology implementation in fir ms, a mix of large, mid -sized, and small  firms 
should be selected to examine whether the technology implementation process differs with firm 
size.  Site selection should not be opportunistic or based on convenience, but rather based on 
the fit with researc h questions  though a process called “theoretical sampling .” 
 Fifth, what techniques of data collection should be used in case research?  A lthough  
interview (either open -ended /unstructured  or focused/structured)  is by far the most popular 
data collection technique for case research, interview data can be supplemented or 
corroborated with other techniques  such as  direct observation (e.g., attending executive 
meetings, briefings, and planning sessions), documentation (e.g., internal reports, 
presentations, and  memoranda, as well as external accounts such as newspaper reports), 
archival records (e.g., organization charts, financial records, etc.), and physical artifacts (e.g., 
devices, outputs, tools).  Furthermore , the researcher should triangulate or validate observed 
data by comparing responses between interviewees.   
Conducting Case Research  
 Most case research studies tend to be interpretive in nature.  Interpretive case research 
is an inductive technique where evidence collected from one or more case sites is systematically 
analyzed and synthesized to allow concepts and patterns to emerge for the purpose of building 
new theories or expanding existing ones.  Eisenhardt (1989)10 propose  a “roadmap” for 
buildin g theories from case research, a slightly modified version of which is described below .  
For positivist case research, some of the following  stages may need to be rearran ged or 
modified; however sampling, data collection, and data analytic techniques should generally 
remain the same.  
Define research questio ns.  Like any other scientific research , case research must also 
start with defining research questions  that are theoretically a nd practically interesting , and 
identifying some intuitive expectations about possible answers to those research questions or 
preliminary constructs to guide initi al case design.  In positivist  case research, the preliminary 
constructs are based on theory, while no such theory or hypotheses should be considered ex 
ante  in interpretive research.  These research questions and const ructs may be changed in 
interpretive case research  later on , if needed, but not in positivist  case research.  
Select case sites.   The researcher should u se a process of “theoretical  sampling ” (not 
random sampling) to identify case sites.  In this approach, case sites are chosen based on 
theoretical, rather than statistical, considerations , for instance, to replicate previous cases, to 
extend preliminary  theories, or to fill theoretical categories  or polar types .  Care should be 
taken to ensure that the selec ted sites fit the nature of research questions , minimize extraneous 
variance or noise due to firm size, industry effe cts, and so forth, and maximiz e variance  in the 
dependent variables of interest.  For instance, if the goal of the research is to examine how some 
firms innovate better than others, the researcher should select firms of similar size within the

 same industry to reduce industry or size effects, and select  some more innovative and some less 
innovative firms to increase variation in firm innovation .  Instead of cold -calling or writing to a 
potential site, it is better to contact someone at executive level inside each  firm who has the 
authority to approve the  project or someone who can identify a person of authority.  During 
initial conversations, the researcher should describe the nature and purpose of the project, any 
potential benefits to the case site, how the collected data will be used, the people involv ed in 
data collection (other researchers, research assistants, etc.), desired interviewees, and the 
amount of time, effort, and expense required of the sponsoring organization.  The researcher 
must also assure confidentiality, privacy, and anonymity of bot h the firm and the individual 
respondents.   
Create instruments and protocols.   Since the primary mode of data collection in case 
research is interviews, an interview protocol should be designed  to guide the interview process .  
This is essentially a list o f questions to be asked.  Questions may be open -ended (unstructured) 
or closed -ended (structured) or a combination of both.  The interview protocol m ust be strictly 
followed, and the interviewer must not change the order of questions or skip any question  
during the interview process , although some deviations are allowed to probe further into 
respondent’s comments that are ambiguous or interesting.  The interviewer must maintain a 
neutral tone, not lead respond ents in any specific di rection, say by agree ing or disagree ing with 
any response.  More detailed interviewing techniques are discussed in the chapter on surveys.   
In addition, additional sources of data, such as internal documents and memorandums, annual 
reports, financial statements, newspaper articles, and direct observations should be sought to 
supplement and validate interview data.  
Select respondents.  Select interview respondents at different organizational levels, 
departments, and positions to obtain divergent perspectives on the  phenomenon of interest.  A 
random sampling of interviewees is most preferable; however a snowball sample  is acceptable, 
as long as a diversity of perspectives is represented in the sample.  Interviewees must be 
selected based on their personal involvement  with the phenomenon under investigation and 
their ability and willingness to answer the researcher’s questions accurately and adequately, 
and not based on convenience or access.  
Start data collection .  It is usually a good idea to electronic ally record in terviews for 
future reference.  However, such recording must only be done with the interviewee’s consent.  
Even when interviews are being recorded, the interviewer should take notes to capture 
important comments or critical observations, behavioral respons es (e.g., respondent’s body 
language), and the researcher’s personal impressions about the respondent and his/her 
comments.  After each interview is completed, the entire interview should be transcribed 
verbatim into a text document for analysis.  
Conduct w ithin -case data analysis.  Data analysis may follow or overlap with data 
collection.  Overlapping d ata collection and analysis has the advantage of adjusting the data 
collection process based on themes emerging from  data analysis , or to further probe into these 
themes.  Data analysis is done in two stages.  In the first stage (within -case analysis), the 
researcher should examine emergent concepts separately at each case site and patterns 
between these concepts to generate an initial theory of the problem of  interest.  The researcher 
can interview data subjectively to “make sense” of the research problem in conjunction with 
using her personal observations or experience at the case site.  Alternatively, a coding strategy 
such as Glasser and Strauss’ (1967) grounded theory approach, using techniques such as open 
coding, axial coding, and selective coding, may be used to derive a chain of evidence and 
C a s e  R e s e a r c h  | 97 
 
 
 inferences.  These techniques are discussed in detail in a later chapter.  Homegrown techniques, 
such as graphica l representation of data (e.g., network diagram) or sequence analysis (for 
longitudinal data)  may also be used.  Note that there is no predefined way of analyzing the 
various types of case data , and the data analytic techniques can be modified to fit the n ature of 
the research project .  
 Conduct cross -case analysis.   Multi -site case research requires cross -case analysis as the 
second stage of data analysis.  In such analysis, the researcher should look for similar concepts 
and patterns between different case sites, ignoring contextual differences that may lead to 
idiosyncratic conclusions.  Such patterns may be used for validating the initial theory, or for 
refining it (by adding or dropping concept s and relationships) to develop a more inclusive and 
generalizable theory.  This analysis may take several forms.  For instance, the researcher may 
select categories (e.g., firm size, industry, etc.) and look for within -group similarities and 
between -group  differences (e.g., high versus low performers, innovators versus laggards).  
Alternatively, she can compare firms in a pair -wise manner listing similarities and differences 
across pairs of firms.   
Build and test hypotheses.   Based on emergent concepts an d themes that are 
generalizable across case sites, tentative hypotheses  are constructed .  These hypotheses should 
be compared iteratively with observed evidence to see if they fit the observed data, and if not, 
the constructs or relationships  should be ref ined .  Also the researcher should compare the 
emergent constructs and hypotheses with those reported in the prior literature to make a case 
for their internal validity and generalizability.  Conflicting findings must not be rejected, but 
rather reconciled using creative thinking to generate greater insight into the emergent theory.  
When further iterations between theory and data yield no new insights or changes in the 
existing theory, “theoretical saturation ” is reached and the theory building process is c omplete.  
Write case research report.   In writing the report, the researcher should describe very 
clearly the detailed process used for sampling, data collection, data analysis, and hypotheses 
development, so that reader s can independently assess the  reason ableness, strength, and 
consistency  of the reported inferences .  A high level of clarity in research methods is needed to 
ensure that the findings are not biased by the researcher’s preconceptions.  
Interpretive Case Research Exemplar  
Perhaps the best way t o learn about interpretive case research is to  examine an 
illustrative example.  One such example is  Eisenhardt’s (1989)11 study of how executives make 
decisions  in high -velocity environments (HVE).  Readers are advised to read the original paper 
published in Academy of Management Journal  before reading the synopsis in this chapter.  In  
this study, Eisenhardt examine d how executive teams in some HVE firms make fast decisions, 
while those in other firms cannot, and whether faster decisions improve or worsen firm 
performan ce in such environments.  HVE was defined as one where demand, competition, and 
technology changes s o rapidly and discontinuously that the information available is often 
inaccurate, unavailable or obsolete.  The i mplic it assumptions we re that (1) it is hard to make 
fast decisions with inadequate information in HVE, and (2) fast decisions may not be effic ient 
and may result in poor firm performance.

 Reviewing the prior literature on executive decision -making, Eisenhardt found several 
patterns, although none of these patterns were specific to high -velocity environments.  The 
literature suggested that in t he interest of expediency, firms that make faster decisions obtain 
input from fewer sources, consider fewer alternatives, make limited analysis, restrict user 
participation in decision -making, centralize decision -making authority, and has limited internal 
conflicts.  However, Ei senhardt contend ed that these views may not necessarily explain how 
decision makers make decisions in high -velocity environments, where decisions must be made 
quickly and with incomplete information, while maintaining high decision q uality.  
To examine this  phenomenon , Eisenhardt conducted an inductive study of eight firms in 
the personal computing industry.  The personal computing industry was undergoing dramatic 
changes in technology with the introduction of the UNIX operating system , RISC architecture, 
and 64KB random access memory in the 1980’s, increased competition with the entry of IBM 
into the personal computing business, and growing customer demand with double -digit 
demand growth, and therefore fit the profile of the high -veloc ity environment.  This was a 
multiple case design with replication logic, where  each case was expected to confirm or 
disconfirm inferences from other cases.  C ase sites were selected based on their access a nd 
proximity to the researcher; however, a ll of th ese firms operated in the high -velocity personal 
computing industry in California’s Silicon Valley area .  The collocation of firms in the same 
industry and the same area ruled out any “noise” or varia nce in dependent variables (decision 
speed  or performanc e) attributable to industry or geographic  differences .   
The study employed an embedded design with multiple levels of analysis: decision 
(comparing multiple strategic decisions within each firm), executive teams (comparing 
different teams responsible for strategic decisions), and the firm (overall firm performance).  
Data was collected from five sources:  
 Initial interviews with Chief Executive Officers: CEOs were asked questions about their 
firm’s competitive strategy, distinctive competencies, major competitors, performance, 
and recent/ongoing major strategic decisions.  Based on these interviews, several 
strategic decisions were selected in each firm for further investigation.  Four criteria 
were used to select decisions: (1) the decisions involve d the firm’s strategic positioning, 
(2) the decisions had high stakes, (3) the decisions involved multiple functions, and (4) 
the decisions were representative of strategic decision -making process in that firm.  
 Interviews with divisional heads:  Each division al head was asked sixteen open -ended 
questions, ranging from their firm’s competitive strategy, functional strategy, top 
management team members, frequency and nature of interaction with team, typical 
decision making processes, how each of the previously i dentified decision was made, 
and how long it took them to make those decisions.  Interviews lasted between 1.5 and 2 
hours, and sometimes extended to 4 hours.  To focus on facts and actual events rather 
than respondents’ perceptions or interpretations, a “ courtroom” style questioning was 
employed, such as when did this happen, what did you do, etc.  Interview s were  
conducted by two people, and the data was validated by cross -checking facts and 
impressions made by the interviewer and note -taker.  All intervi ew data was recorded, 
however notes were also taken during each interview , which  ended with the 
interviewer’s overall impressions.   Using a “24 -hour rule”, detailed field notes were 
completed within 24 hours of the interview, so that some data or impressio ns were not 
lost to recall.   
C a s e  R e s e a r c h  | 99 
 
 
  Questionnaires:  Executive team members at each firm were complete d a survey 
questionnaire that captured quantitative data on the extent of conflict and power 
distribution in their firm.  
 Secondary data:  Industry reports and i nternal documents such as demographics of the 
executive teams (responsible for strategic decisions), financial performance of firms, 
and so forth , were examined . 
 Personal observation:  Lastly , the researcher attended a 1 -day strategy session and a 
weekly e xecutive meeting at two firms in her sample.  
Data analysis involved a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques.  
Quantitative data on conflict and power were analyzed for patterns across firms/decisions.  
Qualitative interview data was combin ed into decision climate profiles, using profile traits (e.g., 
impatience) mentioned by more than one executive.  For within -case analysis, decision stories 
were created for each strategic decision by combining executive accounts of the key decision 
events  into a timeline.  For cross -case analysis, pairs of firms were compared  for similarities 
and differences, categori zed along variables of interest  such as decision speed and firm 
performance.  Based on these analyses, tentative constructs and propositions were derived 
inductively from each decision story within firm categories.  Each decision case was revisited to 
confirm the proposed relationship s.  The inferred propositions were compared with findings 
from the existing literature to reconcile examine diff erences with the extant literature and to 
generate new insights from the case findings.  Finally, the validated propositions were 
synthesized into an inductive theory of strategic decision -making by firms in high -velocity 
environments.  
Inferences derived from this multiple case research contradicted several decision -
making patterns expected from the existing literature.  First, fast decision makers  in high -
velocity environments used more information, and not less information as suggested by the 
previous literature.  However , these decision makers used more real -time  information (an 
insight not  available from prior research), which helped  them identify and respond to problems, 
opportunities , and changing circumstances  faster .  Second, fast decision makers examined more 
(not fewer) alternatives.  However, they considered these multiple alternatives in a 
simultaneous  manner, while slower decision makers examined fewer alternatives  in a sequential  
manner .  Third, fast decision makers did not centralize decision making or restrict inputs from 
others, as the literature suggested.  Rather, these firms used a two -tiered decision process in 
which experienced counselors were asked for inputs  in the first stage, following by a rapid 
comparison and decision selection in the second stage.  Fourth, fast decision makers did not 
have less conflict, as expected from the literature, but employed better conflict resolution 
techniques to reduce conflic t and improve decision -making speed.  Finally, fast decision makers 
exhibited superior firm performance by virtue of their built -in cognitive, emotional, and 
political processes that led to rapid closure of major decisions.   
Positivist  Case Research Exemp lar 
 Case research can also be used in a positivist  manner to test theories or hypotheses.  
Such studies are rare, but Markus  (1983)12 provides an exemplary illustration in her study of 
technology implementation at the Golden Triangle Company (a pseudonym).  The goal of this 
study was to understand why a newly implemented financial information system (FIS),

 intended to improve the productivity and performance of accountants at GTC was supported by 
accountants at GTC’s co rporate headquarters but resisted by divisional accountants at GTC 
branches.  Given the uniqueness of the phenomenon of interest, this was a single -case research 
study.  
 To explore the reasons behind user resistance of FIS, Markus posited three alternative  
explanations:  (1) system -determined theory: resistance was caused by factors related to an 
inadequate system, such as its technical deficiencies, poor ergonomic design, or lack of user 
friendliness , (2) people -determined theory:  resistance was caused by f actors internal to users, 
such as the accountants’ cognitive styles or personality traits that were incompatible with using 
the syst em, and (3) interaction theory:  resistance was not caused not by factors intrinsic to the 
system or the people, but by the i nteraction between the two set of factors.  Specifically, 
interaction theory suggested that the FIS engendered a redistributio n of intra -organizational 
power, and accountants who lost organizational status, relevance, or power as a result of FIS 
implementa tion resisted the system while those gaining power favored it.   
 In order to test the three theories, Markus predicted alternative outcomes expected 
from each theoretical explanation and analyzed the extent to which those predictions matched 
with her obse rvations at GTC.  For instance, the system -determined theory suggested that since 
user resistance was caused by an inadequate system, fixing the technical problems of the 
system would eliminate resistance.  The computer running the FIS system was subsequen tly 
upgraded with a more powerful operating system, online processing (from initial batch 
processing, which delayed immediate processing of accounting information), and a simplified 
software for new account creation by managers.  One year after these chang es were made, the 
resistant users were still resisting the system and felt that it should be replaced.  Hence, the 
system -determined theory was rejected.  
 The people -determined theory predicted that replacing individual resistors or co -opting 
them with les s resistant users would reduce their resistance toward the FIS.  Subsequently, GTC 
started a job rotation and mobility policy, moving accountants in and out of the resistant 
divisions, but resistance not only persisted, but in some cases increased!  In one  specific 
instance, one accountant, who was one of the system’s designers and advocates when he 
worked  for corporate accounting, started resisting the system after he was moved to the 
divisional controller’s office.  Failure to realize the predictions of t he people -determined theory 
led to the rejection of this theory.  
 Finally, the interaction theory predicted that neither changing the system or the people 
(i.e., user education or job rotation policies) will reduce resistance as long as the power 
imbalance  and redistribution from the pre -implementation phase were not addressed.  Before 
FIS implementation, divisional accountants at GTC felt that they owned all accounting data 
related to their divisional operations.  They maintained this data in thick, manual  ledger books, 
controlled others’ access to the  data, and could reconcile unusual accounting events before 
releasing those reports.  Corporate accountants relied heavily on divisional accountants for 
access to the divisional data for corporate reporting an d consolidation .  Because the FIS system 
automatically collected all data at source and consolidated them into a single corporate 
database, it obviated the need for divisional accountants, loosened their control and autonomy 
over their division’s accountin g data, and making their job somewhat irrelevant.  C orporate 
accountants could now query the database and access divisional data directly without going 
through the divisional accountants , analyze and compare the performance of individual 
divisions, and rep ort unusual patterns and activities to the executive committee, resulting in 
C a s e  R e s e a r c h  | 101 
 
 
 further erosion of the divisions’ power.  Though Markus did not empirically test this theory, her 
observations about the redistribution of organizational power, coupled with the r ejection of the 
two alternative theories, led to the justification of interaction theory.  
Comparisons with Traditional Research  
Positivist  case research, aimed at hypotheses testing, is often criticized by natural 
science researchers as lacking in controlled observations, controlled deductions, replicability, 
and generalizability of findings – the traditional principles of positivist researc h.  However, 
these criticisms can be overcome through appropriate case research designs.  For instance, the 
problem of controlled observations refers to the difficulty of obtaining experimental or 
statistical control in case research.  However, case resear chers can compensate for such lack of 
controls b y employing “natural controls.”  This natural control i n Markus’ (1983) study was the 
corporate accountant who was one of the system advocates initially , but  started resisting it 
once he moved to controlling division.  In this instance, the change in his behavior may be 
attributed to his new divisional position.  However, such natural controls cannot be anticipated  
in advance , and case researchers may overlook then  unless they are proactively looking for  
such controls .  Incidentally, natural controls are also used in natural science disciplines such as 
astronomy, geology, and human biology , such as wait for comets to pass close enough to the 
earth in order to make inferences about comets and their composition . 
The problem of controlled deduction refers to the lack of adequate quantitative 
evidence to support inferences, given the mostly qualitative nature of case research data.  
Despite the lack of quantitative data for hypotheses testing (e.g., t -tests), contro lled deductions 
can still be obtained in case research by generating behavioral predictions based on theoretical 
considerations and testing those predictions over time.  Markus employed this strategy in her 
study by generating three alternative theoretical  hypotheses f or user resistance, and rejecting  
two of those predictions when they did not match with actual observed behavior.  In this case, 
the hypotheses were tested using  logical propositions rather than using mathematical tests, 
which are just as valid as statistical inferences since mathematics is a subset of logic.  
Third, the problem of replicability refers to the difficulty of observing the same 
phenomenon given the uniqueness and idiosyncrasy of a given ca se site.  However, using 
Markus’ three theories as an illustration, a different researcher can test the same theories at a 
different case site, where three different predictions may emerge based on the idiosyncratic 
nature of the new case site, and the thr ee resulting predictions may be tested  accordingly .  In 
other words, it is possible to replicate the inferences of case research, even if the case research 
site or context may not be replicable.  
Fourth, case research tends to examine unique and non -replica ble phenomena that may 
not be generalized to other settings.  Generalizability in natural sciences is established through 
additional studies.  Likewise, additional case studies conducted in different contexts with 
different predictions can establish genera lizability of findings if such findings are observed to 
be consistent across studies.  
 Lastly, British philosopher Karl Popper described four requirements of scientific 
theories: (1) theories should be falsifiable, (2) they should be logically consistent, (3) they 
should have adequate predictive ability, and (4) they should provide better explanation than 
rival theories.  In case research, the first three requirements can be increased by increasing the 
degrees of freedom of observed findings, such as by inc reasing the number of case sites, the 
102 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 number of alternative predictions, and the number of levels of analysis examined.  This was 
accomplished in Markus’ study by examining the behavior of multiple groups (divisional 
accountants and corporate accountants) and providing multiple (three) rival explanations.  
Popper’s fourth condition was accomplished in this study when one hypothesis was found to 
match observed evidence better than the two rival hypotheses.

Interpretive  Research  
 
  
The last chapter introduced interpretive research, or more specifically, interpretive case 
research.  This chapter will explore other kinds of interpretive research.  Recall that positivist 
or deductive methods, such as laboratory experiments and survey re search, are those that are 
specifically intended for theory (or hypotheses) testing, while interpretive or inductive 
methods, such as action research and ethnography, are intended for theory building.  Unlike a 
positivist method, where the researcher start s with a theory and tests theoretical postulates 
using empirical data, in interpretive methods, the researcher starts with data and tries to derive 
a theory about the phenomenon of interest from the observed data.   
The term “interpretive research ” is ofte n used loosely and synonymously with 
“qualitative research”, although the two concepts are quite different.  Interpretive research is a 
research paradigm (see Chapter 3) that is based on the assumption that social reality is not 
singular or objective, but is rather shaped by human experiences and social contexts (ontology), 
and is therefore best studied within its socio -historic context by reconciling the subjective 
interpretations of its various participants (epist emology).  Because interpretive  researchers 
view social reality as being embedded within and impossible to abstract  from their social 
settings, they “interpret” the reality though a “sense -making” process rather than a hypothesis 
testing  process .  This is in contrast to the positivist or functionalist paradigm that assumes that 
the reality is relatively independent of the context, can be abstracted from their contexts , and 
studied in a decomposable functional manner using objective  techniques such as standa rdized 
measures .  Whether a researcher should pursue interpretive or positivist research depends on 
paradigmatic considerations about the nature of the phenomenon under consideration and the 
best way to study it.  
 However, qualitative versus quantitative r esearch refers to empirical or data -oriented 
considerations about the type of data to collect and how to analyze them.  Q ualitative research 
relies mostly on non -numeric data, such as interviews and observations, in contrast to 
quantitative research which employs numeric data  such as scores and metrics .  Hence, 
qualitative research is not amenable to statistical procedures such as regression  analysis, but is 
coded using techniques like content analysis .  Sometimes, coded qualitative da ta is tabulated 
quantitatively as frequencies  of codes , but this data is not statistically analyzed .  Many puritan 
interpretive  researchers  reject this coding approach as a futile effort to seek consensus or 
objectivity in a social phenomenon  which is essentially subjecti ve.  
Although interpretive research tends to rely heavily on qualitative data, quantitative 
data  may add more precision and clearer understanding of the phenomenon of interest than 
104 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 qualitative data.  For example, Eisenhardt (1989), in her interpretive stud y of decision making n 
high -velocity firms (discussed in the previous chapter on case research), collected numeric data 
on how long it took each firm to make certain strategic decisions (which ranged from 1.5 
months to 18 months), how many decision alterna tives were considered for each decision, and 
surveyed her respondents to capture their perceptions of organizational conflict.  Such numeric 
data helped her clearly distinguish the high -speed decision making firms from the low -speed 
decision makers, withou t relying on respondents’ subjective perceptions, which then allowed 
her to examine the number of decision alternatives considered by and the extent of conflict in 
high -speed versus low -speed firms .  Interpretive research should attempt to collect both 
qualitative and quantitative data pertaining to their phenomenon of interest, and so should 
positivist research as well.  Joint use of qualitative and quantitative data , often called “mixed -
mode designs”, may lead to unique insight s and are highly prized in the scientific community . 
Interpretive research has its roots in anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, 
and semiotics, and has been available since  the early 19th century , long before positivist  
techniques  were developed .  Many positivist resear chers view interpretive research as 
erroneous  and bias ed, given the subjective nature of the qualitative data collection and 
interpretation  process  employed in such research .  However, the failure of many positivist 
techniques to generate interes ting insights or new knowledge have resulted in a resurgence of 
interest in interpretive research  since the 1970’s , albeit with exacting methods  and stringent 
criteria to ensure the reliability and validity of interpretive inferences.   
Distinctions from Positivist  Research  
In addition to fundamental paradigmatic differen ces in ontological and epistemological 
assumptions discussed above, interpretive and positivist research differ in several other ways .  
First, interpretive  research employs a theoretical  sampling  strate gy, where study sites, 
respondents, or cases are selected based on theoretical considerations such as whether they fit 
the phenomenon being studied (e.g., sustainable practices can only be studied in organizations 
that have implemented susta inable practices), whether they possess certain characteristics  that 
make them uniquely suited for the study (e.g., a study of the drivers of firm innovations should 
include some firms that are high innovators and some that are low innovators, in order to draw 
contrast between these firms), and so forth .  In contrast, positivist  research e mploys random 
sampling  (or a variation of this technique), where cases are chosen randomly from a population , 
for purposes of generalizability .  Hence , convenience samples and small samples are considered 
acceptable in interpretive  research as long as they fit the nature and purpose of the study , but 
not in positivist  research . 
Second, the role of the researcher receives critical attention in interpreti ve research.  In 
some methods such as ethnography, action research, and participant observation, the 
researcher is considered part of the social phenomenon, and her specific role and involvement 
in the research process must be made clear during data analys is.  In other methods, such as case 
research, the researcher must take a “neutral” or unbiased stance during the data collection and 
analysis processes, and ensure that her personal biases or preconceptions does not taint the 
nature of subjective inference s derived from interpretive  research.  In positivist  research , 
however, the researcher is considered to be external to and independent of the research context 
and is not presumed to bias the data collection a nd analytic procedures . 
Third, interpretive  analysis is holistic and contextual, rather than being reductionist  and 
isolationist.  Interpretive  interpretations tend to focus on language, signs, and meanings  from 
I n t e r p r e t i v e  R e s e a r c h  | 105 
 
 
 the perspective of the participants  involved in the social phenomenon, in contrast to s tatistical 
techniques that are employed heavily in positivist  research.  Rigor in interpretive  research is 
viewed in terms of systematic and transparent approaches for data collection and analysis 
rather than statistical benchmarks for construct validity o r significance  testing .   
Lastly, data collection and analysis can proceed simultaneously and iteratively in 
interpretive research.  For instance, the researcher may conduct an interview and code it before 
proceeding to the next interview.  Simultaneous an alysis helps the researcher correct potential 
flaws in the interview protocol or adjust it to capture the phenomenon of interest better.  The 
researcher may even change her original research question if she realizes that her original 
research questions are  unlikely to generate new or useful insights.  This is a valuable but  often 
understated benefit of interpretive  research, and is not available in positivist  research, where 
the research project cannot be modified or changed once the data collection has sta rted without 
redoing the entire project from the start.  
Benefits and Challenges of Interpretive  Research  
Interpretive  research has several unique advantages .  First, they are well -suited for 
exploring hidden reasons behind complex, interrelated, or multifaceted social processes, such 
as inter -firm relationships or inter -office politics, where quantitative evidence may be biased, 
inaccurate,  or otherwise difficult to obtain.  Second,  they are often helpful for theory 
construction in areas with no or insufficient a priori theory.  Third, they are also appropriate for 
studying context -specific, unique, or idiosyncratic events or processes.  Fourth, interpretive  
research can also help uncover interesting and relevant research questions and issues for 
follow -up research.  
At the same time, interpretive  research also has its own set of challenges.  First, this 
type of research tends to be more time and resource intensive  than positivist  research  in data 
collection and analytic efforts .  Too little data can lead to false or premature assumptions, while 
too much data may not be effectively processed by the researcher.  Second, interpretive  
research requires well -trained researchers who are capable of seeing and interpret ing complex 
social phenomenon from the perspectives of the embedded participants and reconciling the 
diverse perspectives of these participants, without injecting their personal biases or 
preconceptions into the ir inferences .  Third, all participants or data sources may not be equally 
credible, unbiased, or knowledgeable about the phenomenon of interest, or may have 
undisclosed political agendas, which may lead to misleading or false impressions.  Inadequate 
trust between par ticipants and researcher may hinder full and honest self -representation by 
participants, and such trust building takes time.  It is the job of the interpretive  researcher to 
“see through the smoke” (hidden or biased agendas) and understand the true nature of the 
problem.  Fourth, given the heavily contextualized nature of inferences drawn from interpretive  
research, such inferences do  not lend themselves well to replicability or generalizability .  
Finally, interpretive  research may sometimes fail to answer the rese arch questions of interest 
or predict future behaviors.   
Characteristics of Interpretive  Research  
 All interpretive  research must adhere  to a common set of principles, as described below.  
Naturalistic inquiry:   Social phenomena must be studied within their natural setting.   
Because interpretive  research assumes that social phenomena are situated within and cannot 
106 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 be isolated from their social context , interpretations of such phenomena must be grounded  
within the ir socio -historical context.  This  implies that contextual variables should be observed 
and considered in seeking explanations of a phenomenon of interest, even though context 
sensitivity may limit  the general izability of inferences . 
Researcher as instrument:   Researchers are often embedded within the social context 
that they are study ing, and are considered part of the data collection instrument in that they 
must  use their observational skills, their trust with the participants, and their ability to extract 
the correct information.  Further, their personal insights, knowledge, and experiences of the 
social context is critical to accurately interpreting the phenomenon  of interest .  At the same 
time, researchers must be fully aware of their personal biases and p reconceptions, and not let 
such biases interfere with their ability to present a fair and accurate portrayal of the 
phenomenon.    
Interpretive analysis:   Observations must be interpreted through the eyes of the 
participants embedded in the social  context .  Interpretation must occur at two levels.  The first 
level involves viewing or experiencing the phenomenon from the subjective perspectives of the  
social participants .  The second level is to understand the meaning of the participants’ 
experiences in order  to provide a “thick description” or a rich narrative story of the 
phenomenon of interest  that can communicate  why participants  acted the way they did . 
Use of expressive language:   Documenting the verbal and non -verbal language of 
participants  and the anal ysis of such language are integral components of interpretive  analysis.  
The study must ensure that the story is viewed through the eyes of a person, and not a machine, 
and must depict the emotions and experiences of that person, so that readers can unders tand 
and relate to that person.  Use of imageries, metaphors, sarcasm, and other figures of speech is 
very common in interpretive  analysis.  
Temporal nature:  Interpretive  research is often not concerned with searching for 
specific answers, but with understanding or “making sense of” a dynamic social process as it 
unfolds over time.  Hence, such research requires an immersive involvement of the researcher 
at the study site for an extended period of time in order to capture the entire evolution of the 
phenomenon of interest.   
Hermeneutic circle:   Interpretive  interpretation is an iterative process of moving back 
and forth from pieces of observation s (text) to the entirety of  the social phenomenon (context) 
to reconcile their apparent discord and to construct a theory that is consistent with the diverse 
subjective viewpoints and experiences of the embedded participants .  Such iterations between 
the understanding/meaning of a p henomenon and observations must continue until 
“theoretical saturation” is reached, whereby any additional iteration does not yield any more 
insight into the phenomenon of interest.  
Interpretive  Data Collection  
Data is collected in interpretive  research using  a variety of  techniques .  The most 
frequently used technique is interviews  (face -to-face, telephone, or focus group s).  Interview 
types and strategies are discussed in detail in a previous chapter on survey research.  A second 
technique is observation .  Observational techniques include direct observation , where the 
researcher is a neutral and passive external observer and is not involved in the phenomenon of 
interest  (as in case research) , and participant observation , where the researcher is an active 
I n t e r p r e t i v e  R e s e a r c h  | 107 
 
 
 participant in the phenomenon and her inputs or mere presence influence the phenomenon 
being studied  (as in action research ).  A third technique is documentation , where external and 
internal documents, such as memo s, electronic mails, annual reports, finan cial statements, 
newspaper articles, website s, may be used to cast further insight into the phenomenon of 
interest  or to corroborate  other forms of evidence . 
Interpretive  Research  Designs  
Case research .  As discussed in the previous chapter, case research is an intensive 
longitudinal study of a phenomenon at one or more research sites for the purpose of deriving 
detailed, contextualized inferences and understanding the dynamic process underlying a 
pheno menon  of interest .  Case research is a unique research design in that it can be used in an 
interpretive  manner to build theories or in a positivist manner to test theories .  The previous 
chapter on case research discusses both techniques in depth and provi des illustrative 
exemplars.  Furthermore, the case researcher is a neutral observer (direct observation) in the 
social setting rather than an active participant (participant observation).  As with any other 
interpretive  approach , drawing meaningful inferen ces from case research depends heavily on 
the observational skills and integrativ e abilities of the researcher.  
Action research .  Action research is a qualitative but positivist research design aimed 
at theory testing rather than theory building (discusse d in this chapter due to lack of a proper 
space).  This is an interactive design that assumes that complex social phenomena are best 
understood by introducing changes, interventions, or “actions” into those phenomena and 
observing the outcomes of such actions on the phenomena of interest.  In this method, the 
researcher is usually a consultant or an organizational member embedded into a social context 
(such as an organization), who initiates an action in response to a social problem, and examines 
how her action influences the phenomenon while also  learning and generating insights about 
the relationship between the action and the phenomenon .  Examples of actions may include 
organizational change programs, such as the introduction of new organizational process es, 
procedures, people, or technology or replacement of old ones, initiated with the goal of 
improving an organization’s performance or profitability in its business environment.  The 
researcher’s choice of actions must be based on theory, which should exp lain why and how such 
actions may bring forth the desired social change.  The theory is validated by the extent to 
which the chosen action is successful in remedying  the targeted problem.  Simultaneous 
problem solving and insight generation is the central feature that distinguishes action research 
from othe r research methods  (which may not involve  problem solving) and from consulting 
(which may not involve insight generation) .  Hence, action research is an excellent method for 
bridging research and practice.   
   There are several variations of the action research method.  The most popular of these 
method is the participatory action research, designed by Susman and Evered (1978)13.  This 
method follows an action research cycle consisting of five phases : (1) diagnosing, (2) action 
planning, (3) action taking, (4) evaluating, and (5) learning (see Figure 10.1).  Diagnosing  
involves identifying and defining a problem in its social cont ext.  Action planning  involves 
identifying and evaluating alternative solutions to the problem, and deciding on a future course 
of action (based on theoretical rationale).  Action taking  is the implementation of the planned 
course of action.  The evaluatio n stage exami nes the extent to which the initiated action is

 successful in resolving  the original prob lem, i.e., whether theorized effects a re indeed realized 
in practice.  In the learning  phase, the experiences and feedback from action evaluation are used  
to generate insights about the problem and suggest future modifications or improvements to 
the action.  Based on action evaluation and learning, the action may be modified or adjusted to 
address the problem better, and the action research cycle is repeate d with the modified action 
sequence .  It is suggest ed that the entire action research cycle be traversed at least twice so that 
learning from the first cycle can be implemented in the second cycle.  The primary mode of data 
collection is participant observation, although other techniques such as interviews and 
documentary evidence may be used to corroborate the researcher’s observations.  
 
Figure 10.1.  Action research cycle  
 
Ethnography .  The ethnographic research method, derived largely from the field of 
anthropology, emphasizes studying a phenomenon within the context of its culture.  The 
researcher must be deeply immersed in the social culture over an extended period of time 
(usually 8 months to 2 years) and should engage, observe, and record the daily life of the 
studied culture and its social participants  within their natural setting.  The primary mode of 
data collection is participant observation , and data analysis involves a “sense -making ” 
approach .  In addition, the researcher must take extensive field notes, and narrate her 
experience in descriptive detail so that readers may experience the same culture  as the 
researcher .  In this  method, the researcher has two roles: rely on her unique knowledge and 
engagement to generate insights (theory), and convince the scientific community of the trans -
situational nature of the studied phenomenon.   
The classic example of ethnographic research is Jane  Goodall’s study of primate 
behaviors, where she lived with chimpanzees in their natural habitat at Gombe National Park in 
Tanzania, observed their behaviors, interacted wit h them, and shared their lives.  During that 
process, she learnt and chronicled how  chimpanzees seek food and shelter, how they socialize 
with each other, their communication patterns, their mat ing b ehaviors, and so forth.  A more 
contemporary  example of ethnographic research is Myra Bluebond -Langer’s (1996)14 study of 
decision making in families with children suffering from life -threatening illnesses, and the 
physical, psychological, environmental, ethical, legal, and cultural  issues that influence such 
decision -making .  The researcher followed the experiences of approximately 80 children  with

 incurable  illnesses and their families  for a period of over two years.  Data collection involved 
participant observation and formal/informal conversations with children, their parents and 
relatives, and health care providers to document their lived e xperience.  
Phenomenology.   Phenomenology is a research method that emphasizes the study of 
conscious experiences as a way of understanding the reality around us.  It is based on the ideas 
of German philosopher Edmund Husserl in the early 20th century who b elieved that human 
experience is the source of all knowledge.  Phenomenology is concerned with the systematic 
reflection and analysis of phenomena associated with conscious experiences, such as human 
judgment, perceptions, and actions,  with the goal of (1) appreciating and describing  social 
reality from the diverse subjective perspectives of the participants involved , and (2) 
understanding the symbolic meanings (“d eep structure”) underlying these  subjective 
experiences.  Phenomenological inquiry requires that researchers eliminate any prior 
assumptions and personal biases, empathize with the participant’s situation, and tune into 
existential dimensions of that situation, so that they can fully understand the deep structure s 
that drives the conscious thinking, feeling, and behavior  of the studied participants . 
 
Figure 10.2.  The existential phenomenological research method  
 
Some researchers view  phenomenology as a philosophy rather than as a research 
method.  In response t o this criticism, Giorgi and Giorgi (2003)15 developed an existential 
phenomenological research method  to guide studies in this area.  This method, illustrated in 
Figure 10.2, can be grouped into data collection and data analysis phases.  In the data collection  
phase, participants embedded in a social phenomenon are interviewed to capture their 
subjective experiences and perspectives regarding the phenomenon under investigation.  
Examples of questions that may be asked include “can you describe a typic al day” or “can you 
describe that particular incident in more detail?”  These interviews are recorded and 
transcribed for further analysis.  During data analysis , the researcher reads the transcripts to : 
(1) get a sense of the whole, and (2) establish “uni ts of significance” that can faithfully represent 
participants’ subjective experiences.  Examples of such units of significance are concepts such  
as “felt space” and “felt time, ” which  are then used to document participants’ psychological

 experiences.  For  instance, did participants feel safe, free, trapped, or joyous when experiencing 
a phenomenon ( “felt -space” )?  Did they feel that their experience was pressured, slow, or 
discontinuous ( “felt -time” )?  Phenomenological analysis should take into account the  
participants’ temporal landscape (i.e., their sense of past, present, and future), and the 
research er must transpose herself in an imaginary sense in the participant’s situati on (i.e., 
temporarily live the participant’s  life).  The participants’ lived exp erience is described in form of 
a narrative or using emergent themes .  The analysis then delves into these themes to identify 
multiple layers of meaning while retaining the fragility and ambiguity of subjects’ lived 
experience s. 
Rigor in Interpretive  Research  
While positivist research employs a “reductionist” approach by simplifying social reality 
into parsimonious theories and laws, interpretive research attempts to interpret social reality 
through the subjective viewpoints of the embedded participan ts within the context where the 
reality is situated.  These interpretations are heavily contextualized, and are naturally less 
generalizable to other contexts.  However, because i nterpretive  analysis is subjective  and 
sensitive to the experiences and insig ht of the embedded researcher , it is often considered less 
rigorous by many positivist (functionalist) researchers.  Because interpretive research is based 
on different set of ontological and epistemological assumptions about social phenomenon than 
positiv ist research, the positivist notions of rigor, such as reliability, internal validity , and 
generalizability,  do not apply in a similar manner.  However, Lincoln and Guba (1985)16 provide 
an alternative set of criteria that can be used to judge the rigor of interpretive  research.   
Dependability.  Interpretive  research can be viewed as dependable or authentic if two 
researchers asses sing the same phenomenon using the same set of evidence independently 
arrive at the same conclusions or the same researcher obser ving the same or a similar 
phenomenon at different times arrive s at similar conclusions.  This concept is similar to that of 
reliability in positivist research, with agreement between two independent researchers being 
similar to the notion of inter -rater r eliability, and agreement between two observations of the 
same phenomenon by the same researcher akin to test -retest reliability.  To ensure 
dependability, interpretive researchers must provide adequate details about their phenomenon 
of interest and the so cial context in which it is embedded so as to allow readers to 
independently authenticate their  interpretive inferences.  
Credibility.   Interpretive  research can be considered credible if readers find its 
inferences to be believable.  This concept is akin t o that of internal validity  in functionalistic 
research.   The credibility of interpretive  research can be improved by providing evidence of the 
researcher’s extended engagement in the field, by demonstrating data triangulation across 
subjects or data colle ction techniques, and by maintaining meticulous data management and 
analytic procedures , such as verbatim transcription of interviews, accurate records of contacts 
and interviews, and clear notes on theoretical and methodological decisions, that can allow an 
independent audit of data collection and analysis  if needed.  
Confirmability.   Confirmability refers to the extent to which the findings reported in 
interpretive  research can be independently confirmed by others (typically, participants).  This 
is simila r to the notion of objectivity in functionalistic research.  Since interpretive  research 
rejects the notion of an objective reality, confirmability is demonstrated in terms of “inter -

 subjectivity ”, i.e., if the study’s participants agree with the inferences derived by the researcher.  
For instance, if a study’s participants generally agree with the inferences drawn by a researcher 
about a phenomenon of interest (based on a review of the research pa per or report), then the 
findings can be viewed as confirmable .   
Transferability.   Transferability in interpretive  research refers to the extent to which 
the findings can be generalized to other settings.  This idea is similar to that of external validity  
in functionalistic research.  The researcher must provide rich, detailed descriptions of the 
research context (“thick description”) and thoroughly describe the structures, assumptions, and 
processes revealed from the data so that readers can independently  assess whether and to what 
extent are the reported findings transferable to other settings.

Qualitative Analysis  
 
  
Qualitative analysis is the analysis of qualitative data such as text data from interview 
transcripts.  Unlike quantitativ e analysis, which is statistics driven and largely independent of 
the researcher, qualitative analysis is heavily dependent on the res earcher’s analytic and 
integrative skills and personal knowledge of the social context where the data is collected.  The 
emphasis in qualitative analysis is “sense making” or understanding  a phenomenon, rather than 
predicting or explaining.  A creative and  investigative mindset is needed for qualitative analysis, 
based on an ethically enlightened and participant -in-context attitude, and a set of analytic 
strate gies.  This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the se qualitative analysis 
strategies .  Interested readers are referred to more authoritative and detailed references such 
as Miles and Huberman ’s (1984)17 seminal book on this topic.  
Grounded Theory  
How can you analyze a vast set qualitative data acquired through participant 
observation, in -depth interviews, focus groups, narratives of audio/video recordings, or 
secondary documents?  One of these techniques for analyzing text data is grounded theory  – 
an inductive technique of interpreting recorded data abo ut a social phenomenon to build  
theories about that phenomenon .  The technique was developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967)18 
in their method of constant comparative analysis  of grounded theory research, and further 
refined by Strauss and Corbin (1990)19 to further illustrate specific coding techniques – a 
process of classifying and categorizing text data segments into a set of codes (concepts), 
categories (constructs), and relationships .  The interpretations are  “grounded in”  (or based on ) 
observed empir ical data, hence the name.  To ensure that the theory is based solely on observed 
evidence, the grounded theory approach requires that researchers suspend any preexisting 
theoretical expectations or biases before data analysis, and let the data dictate the  formulation 
of the theory.   
Strauss and Corbin (1998) describe three coding techniques for analyzing text data: 
open, axial, and selective.  Open coding  is a process aimed at identifying concepts  or key ideas

 that are hidden within textual data, which are potentially related to the phenomenon  of interest .  
The researcher examines the raw textual data line by line to identify discrete events, incidents, 
ideas, actions, perceptions, and interactions of relevance that are coded as concepts  (hence  
called in vivo codes ).  Each concept is linked to specific portions of the text (coding unit) for later 
validation.  Some concepts may be simple, clear, and unambiguous while others may be 
complex, ambiguous, and viewed differently by different participants .  The co ding unit may vary 
with the concepts being extracted.  Simple concepts such as “ organizati onal size”  may include 
just a few words  of text, while complex ones such as “organizational mission”  may span several 
pages.  Concepts can be named using the research er’s own naming convention or standardized 
labels taken from the research literature .  Once a basic set of concepts are identified, these 
concepts can then be used to code the remainder of the data, while simultane ously looking for 
new concepts and refining old concepts.  While coding, it is important to identify the 
recognizable characteristics of each concept, such as its size, color, or level (e.g., high or low), so 
that similar concepts can be grouped  together l ater .  This coding technique is called “open” 
because the researcher is open to and actively seeking new concepts relevant to the 
phenomenon of interest.  
Next, similar concepts are grouped into higher order categories .  While concepts may 
be context -specif ic, categories tend to be broad and generalizable, and ultimately evolve into 
constructs  in a grounded theory.  Categories are needed to reduce the amount of concepts the 
researcher must  work with and to build a “big picture” of the issues salient to under standing a 
social phenomenon.  Categorization can be done is phases, by combining concepts into 
subcategories, and then subcategories into higher order categories.  Constructs from the 
existing literature can be used to name these categorie s, particularly if the goal of the research 
is to extend current theories.  However, caution must be taken while using existing constructs, 
as such constructs may bring with them commonly held beliefs and biases.  For each category, 
its characteristics (or properties) and  dimensions of each characteristic should be identified.  
The dimension  represents a value of a characteristic along a continuum.  For example, a 
“communication media” category may have a characteristic called “speed”, which can be 
dimensionalized as fast, medium, or slow . Such categorization helps differentiate between 
diffe rent kinds of communication media and enables researchers identify patterns  in the data, 
such as which communication media is used for which types of tasks.   
The second phase of grounded theory is axial coding , where the categories and 
subcategories are a ssembled into causal relationships or hypotheses that can tentatively 
explain the phenomenon of interest.  Although distinct from open coding, axial coding can be 
performed simultaneously with open coding.  The relationships between categories may be 
clear ly evident in the data or may be more subtle and implicit.  In the lat ter instance, 
researchers may use a coding scheme ( often  called a “ coding paradigm”, but different from the 
paradigm s discussed in Chapter 3 ) to understand which categories represent conditions  (the 
circumstances in which the phenomenon is embedded), actions /interactions  (the responses of 
individuals to events under these conditions), and consequences  (the outcomes of actions/  
interactions).  As conditions, actions/interactions, and conse quences are identified, theoretical 
propositions start to emerge, and researchers can start explaining why a phenomenon occurs, 
under what conditions, and with what consequences.   
The third and final phase of grounded theory is selective coding , which inv olves 
identifying a central category or a core variable and systematically and logically relating this 
central category to other categories.  The central category can evolve from existing categories 
or can be a  higher order category that subsumes  previousl y coded categories.  New data is 
Q u a l i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s  | 115 
 
 
 selectively sampled to validate the central category and its relationships to other categories  
(i.e., the tentative theory) .  Selective coding limits the range of analysis, and makes it move fast.  
At the same time, the coder must watch out for other categories that may emerge from the new 
data that may be related to the phenomenon of interest (open coding) , which may lead to 
further refinement of the initial theory .  Hence, open, axial, and selective coding may proceed 
simultaneously.  Coding of new data and theory refinement continues until theoretical 
saturation  is reached, i.e., when additional data does not yield any marginal change in the core 
categories or the relationships.   
The “constant comparison” process impli es continuous rearrangement, aggregation, and 
refinement of categories, relationships, and interpretations based on increasing depth of 
understanding, and an iterative interplay of four stages of activities: (1) comparing 
incidents/texts assigned to each c ategory (to validate the category), (2) integrating categories 
and their properties, (3) delimiting the theory (focusing on the core concepts and ignoring less 
relevant concepts), and (4) writing theory (using techniques like memoing, storylining, and 
diag ramming that are discussed in the next chapter).  Having a central category does not 
necessarily mean  that all other categories can be integrated nicely around it.  In order to 
identify key categories that are conditions, action/interactions, and consequen ces of the core 
category, Strauss and Corbin (1990) recommend several integration techniques, such as 
storylining, memoing, or concept mapping .  In storylining , categories and relationships are 
used to explicate and/or refine a story of the observed phenom enon.  Memos are theorized 
write -ups of ideas about substantive concepts and their theoretically coded relationships as 
they evolve during ground theory analysis, and are important tools to keep track of and refine 
ideas that develop during the analysis.  Memoing  is the process of using these memos to 
discover patterns and relationships between categories using two -by-two tables, diagrams, or 
figures, or other illustrative displays.  Concept mapping  is a graphical representation of 
concepts and relationship s between those concepts (e.g., using boxes and arrows).  The major 
concepts are typically laid out on one or more sheets of paper, blackboards, or using graphical 
software programs, linked to each other using arrows, and readjusted to best fit the observe d 
data.  
After a grounded theory is generated, it must be refined for internal consistency and 
logic.  Researchers must ensure that the central construct has the stated characteristics and 
dimensions, and if not, the data analysis may be repeated.  Research er must then ensure that 
the characteristics and dimensions of all categories show variation.  For example, if behavior 
frequency is one such category, then the data must provide evidence of both frequent 
performers and in frequent performers of the focal behavior.  Finally, the theory must be 
validated by comparing it with raw data.  If the theory contradict s with observed evidence, the 
coding process may be repeated to reconcile such contradictions  or unexplained variations .   
Content Analysis  
 Content analysis is the syste matic analysis of the content of a text (e.g., who says what, 
to whom, why, and to what extent and with what effect ) in a quantitative or  qualitative  manner .  
Content analysis typically conducted  as follows .  First, when there are many  texts to analyze 
(e.g., newspaper stories, financial reports, blog postings, online reviews, etc.), the researcher 
begins by sampling a selected set of texts from the population of texts for analysis.  This process 
is not random, but instead, texts that h ave more pertinent content should be chosen selectively.  
Second, the researcher identifies and applies rules to divide each text into segments or “chunks” 
that can be treated as separate units of analysis.  This process is called unitizing .  For example, 
116 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 assumptions , effects, enablers, and barriers  in text s may constitute such unit s.  Third, the 
researcher constructs and applies one or more concepts to each unitized text segment in a 
process called coding .  For coding purposes, a coding scheme is used base d on the themes the 
researcher is searching for or uncovers as she classifies the text.  Finally, the coded data is 
analyzed, often both quantitatively and qualitatively, to determine which themes occur most 
frequently, in what contexts, and how they are r elated to each other.  
 A simple type of content analysis is sentiment analysis  – a technique used to capture 
people’s opinion or attitude toward an object, person, or phenomenon.  Reading online 
messages about a political candidate posted on an online forum and classifying each message as 
positive, negative, or neutral is an example  of such an analysis.   In this case, each message 
represents one unit of analysis.  This analysis will help identify whether the sample as a whole 
is positively or negatively disposed or neutral towards that candidate.  Examining the content of 
online rev iews in a similar manner is another example.  Though this analysis can be done 
manually, for very large data sets (millions of text records), natural language processing and 
text analytics based software programs are available to automate the coding proces s, and 
maintain a record of how people sentiments fluctuate with time.  
 A frequent criticism of content analysis is that it lack s a set  of systematic procedures 
that would allow the analysis to be replicated  by other researchers .  Schilling (2006)20 
address ed this criticism by organizing different content analytic procedures  into a spiral model.  
This model consists  of five levels or phases in interpreting text : (1)  convert recorded tapes into 
raw text data or tra nscripts for content analysis, (2)  convert raw data into condensed protocols, 
(3) convert condensed protocols into a preliminary category system, ( 4) use the preliminary 
category system to generate coded protocols , and ( 5) analyze coded protocols to generate 
interpretation s about the phenomenon of interest.  
 Content analysis has several limitations.  First, the coding process is restricted to the 
information available in text form.  For instance, if a researcher is interested in studying 
people’s views on capital punishment,  but no such archive of text documents is available, then 
the analysis cannot be done .  Second, sampling must be done carefully to avoid sampling bias.  
For instance, if your population is the published research literature on a given topic, then you 
have s ystematically omitted unpublished research or the most recent work that is yet to be 
published.   
Hermeneutic Analysis  
Hermeneutic analysis is a special type of content analysis where the researcher tries to 
“interpret” the subjective meaning of a given text within its socio -historic context.  Unlike 
grounded theory or content analysis , which ignores  the context and meanin g of text documents 
during the coding process, hermeneutic analysis is a truly interpretive technique for analyzing 
qualitative data.  This method assumes that written texts narrate an aut hor’s experience within 
a socio -historic  context, and should be inte rpreted as such within that context .  Therefore, the 
researcher continually iterates between singular interpretation of the text (the part) and a 
holistic understanding of the context (the whole) to develop a fuller understanding of the 
phenomenon in its s ituated context, which German philosopher Martin Heidegger called the

Analysis,” European Journal of Psychological Assessment  (22:1), 28 -37. 
Q u a l i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s  | 117 
 
 
 hermeneutic circle .  The word hermeneutic  (singular) refers to one particular method or strand 
of interpretation.   
More generally, hermeneutics is the study of interpretation and the theory and practice 
of interpretation.  Derived from religious studies and linguistics, traditional hermeneutics, such 
as biblical hermeneutics , refers to the interpretation of written texts, especially i n the areas of 
literature, religion and law (such as the Bible).  In the 20th century, Heidegger suggested that a 
more direct, non -mediated, and authentic way of understanding social reality is to experience it, 
rather than simply observe it, and proposed philosophical hermeneutics , where the focus shifted 
from interpretation to existential understanding.  Heidegger argued that texts are the means by 
which readers can not only read about an author’s experience, but also relive the author’s 
experiences.  Contemporary or  modern  hermeneutics, developed by Heidegger’s students such 
as Hans -Georg Gadamer, further examined the limits of written texts for communicating social 
experiences, and went on to propose a framework of the interpretive process, encompassi ng all 
forms of communication, including written, verbal, and non -verbal, and exploring issues that 
restrict  the communicative ability of written texts, such as presuppositions, language structures 
(e.g., grammar, syntax, etc.), and  semiotics (the study of  written signs such as symbolism, 
metaphor , analogy, and sarcasm ).  The term hermeneutics is sometimes used interchangeably 
and inaccurately with exegesis , which refers to the interpretation or critical ex planation of 
written text only and especially relig ious texts.  
Conclusion s 
 Finally, standard software programs , such as  ATLAS.ti.5, NVivo, and QDA Miner , can be 
used to automate coding processes in qualitative research methods .  These programs can 
quickly and efficiently organize, search, sort, and process large volumes of text data using user -
defined rules.  To guide such  automated analysis , a coding schema should be created, specifying 
the keywords or codes to search for in the text, based on an initial manual examination of 
sample text data.  The schema can be organized in a hierarchical manner to organize codes into 
higher -order codes or constructs.  The coding schema should be val idated using a different 
sample  of texts for accuracy and adequacy.  However, if the coding schema is biased or 
incorr ect, the resulting analysis of the entire population of text may be flawed and non -
interpretable.  However, software programs cannot decipher the meaning behind the certain 
words or phrases or the context within which these words or phrases are used (such as those in 
sarcasms or metaphors), which may lead to significant misinterpretation in large scale 
qualitative analysis.

Quantitative Analysis:  
Descriptive Statistics  
 
  
Numeric data collected in a research project can be analyzed quantitatively using 
statistical tools in two different ways.  Descriptive analysis  refers to statistically describing, 
aggregating , and present ing the constructs of interest or associations between these constructs .  
Inferential analysis  refers to the statistical testing of hypotheses (theory testing).  In this 
chapter, we will examine statistical techniques used for descriptive analysis, and the next 
chapter will examine statistical techniques for inferential analysis.  M uch of today’s quantitative 
data analysis is conducted using software programs such as SPSS or SAS.  Readers are advised 
to familiarize themselves with one of these programs for understanding the concepts described 
in this chapter.  
Data Preparation  
In research project s, data may be collected from a variety of sources: mail -in surveys, 
interviews, pretest or post test experimental data,  observational data, and so forth.  This data 
must be converted into a machine -readable , numeric  format, such as in a spreadsheet or a text 
file, so that they can be analyzed by computer programs  like SPSS or SAS .  Data preparation 
usually follows the following steps.  
Data coding.   Coding is the process of converting data into numeric format.  A codebook 
should be created to guide the coding process.  A codebook  is a comprehensive document 
containing detailed description of each vari able in a research study, items or measures for that 
variable, the format of each item (numeric, text, etc.), the response scale for each item (i.e., 
whether it is measured on a nominal, or dinal, interval, or ratio scale;  whether such scale is a 
five-point , seven -point, or some other type of scale), and how to code each value into a numeric 
format.  For instance, if we have a measurement item on a seven -point Likert scale with anchors 
ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”, we may code that item as 1 for strongly 
disagree, 4 for neutral, and 7 for strongly agree, with the intermediate anchors in between.  
Nominal data such as industry type can be coded in numeric form using a coding scheme such 
as: 1 for manufacturing, 2 for retailing, 3 for financial, 4 for healthcare, and so forth (of course, 
nominal data cannot be analyzed statistical ly).  Ratio scale data such as age, income, or test 
scores can be coded as entered  by the respondent .  Sometimes, data may need to be aggregated 
into a differe nt form than the format used for data collection.  For instance, for measuring a 
construct such as “benefits of computers,” if a survey provided respondents with a checklist of 
120 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 benefits that they could select from (i.e., they could choose as many of those benefits as they 
wanted), then the total number of checked items can be used as an aggregate measure of 
benefits .  Note that many other forms of data, such as interview transcripts , cannot be 
converted into a numeric format  for statistical analysis .  Codin g is especially important for large 
complex studies involving many variables and measurement items, where the coding process is 
conducted by different people, to help the coding team code data  in a consistent manner, and 
also to help others understand and interpret the coded data.   
 Data entry.   Coded d ata can be entered into a spreadsheet, database, text file, or 
directly into a statistical program like SPSS.  Most statistical programs provide a  data editor for 
entering data.  H owever , these programs  store data in their own native format (e.g., SPSS stores 
data as .sav files), which makes it difficult to share that data with other statistical programs.  
Hence, it is often better to enter data into a spreadsheet or database, where they can be 
reorganiz ed as needed, shared across programs, and subsets of data can be extracted for 
analysis.  Smaller data sets with less than 65,000 observati ons and 256 items can be stored in  a 
spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel , while larger dataset with millions of obser vations will 
require a database .  Each observation can be entered as one row in the spreadsheet and each 
measurement item can be represented as one column.  The entered data should be frequently 
checked for accuracy, via occasional spot checks on a set of items or observations, during and 
after entry.   Furthermore, while entering data, the coder should watch out for obvious evidence 
of bad data, such as the respondent selecting the “strongly agree” response to all items 
irrespective of content , including re verse -coded items.   If so, such data can be entered but 
should be ex cluded from subsequent analysis.   
Missing values.   Missing data is an inevitable part of any empirical data set.  
Respondents may not answer certain questions if they are ambiguously word ed or too 
sensitive.  Such problems should be detected earlier during pretests and corrected before the 
main data collection process begins.  During data entry, some statistical programs automatically 
treat blank entries as missing values, while others req uire a specific numeric value such as -1 or 
999 to be entered to denote a missing value.  During data analysis, the default mode of handling 
missing values in most software programs is to simply drop the entire observation containing 
even a single missing value, in a technique called listwise deletion .  Such deletion can 
significantly shrink the sample size and make it extremely difficult to detect small effects.  
Hence, some software programs allow the option of replacing  missing values with an estimate d 
value  via a process called imputation .  For instance, i f the missing value is one item in a multi -
item scale, the imputed value may be the average of the respondent’s responses to remaining 
items on that scale.  If the missing value belongs to a single -item scale, many researchers use the 
average of other respondent’s responses to that item as the imputed value.  Such imputation 
may be biased if the missing value is of a systematic nature rather than a random nature.  Two 
methods that can produce relatively  unbiased estimates for imputation are the maximum 
likelihood procedures and multiple imputation methods, both of which are supported in 
popular software programs such as SPSS and SAS.   
 Data transformation.   Sometimes, it is necessary to transform data v alues before they 
can be meaningfully interpreted.  For instance, reverse coded items, where items convey the 
opposite meaning of that of their underlying construct, should be reversed (e.g., in a 1 -7 interval 
scale, 8 minus the observed value will reverse  the value) before they can be compared or 
combined with items that are not reverse coded.  Other kinds of transformations may include 
creating scale measures by adding individual scale items, creating a weighted index from a set 
Q u a n t i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s :  D e s c r i p t i v e  S t a t i s t i c s  | 121 
 
 
 of observed measures, and collapsing multiple values into fewer categories (e.g., collapsing 
incomes into income ranges).   
Univariate Analysis  
 Univariate analysis, or analysis of a single variable, refers to a set of statistical 
techniques that can describe the general properties  of one variable.  Univariate statistics  
include : (1) frequency distribution, (2) central tendency, and (3) dispersion.  The frequency 
distribution  of a variable is a summary of the frequency (or percentages) of individual values 
or ranges of values for that variable.  For instance, we can measure  how many times a sample of 
respondents attend religious services (as a measure of their “religiosity”) u sing a categorical 
scale: never, once per year, several times per year, about once a month, several times per 
month, several times per week, and an optional category for “did not answer.”  If we count the 
number (or percentage) of observati ons within each category (except  “did not answer” which is 
really a missing value rather than a category), and display it in the form of a table as shown in 
Figure 14 .1, what we have is a frequency distribution.  This distribution  can also be depicted in 
the form of a bar  chart, as shown on the right panel of Figure 14.1, with the horizontal axis 
representing each category of that variable and the vertical axis representing the frequency or 
percentage of observation s within each category.  
 
Figure 14 .1.  Frequency distribution of religiosity  
With very large samples where observations are independent and random, the 
frequency distribution tends to follow a plot that looked like a bell -shaped curve (a smoothed 
bar chart of the frequency distribution) similar to that shown in Figure 14 .2, where most 
observations are clustered toward the center of the range of values, and fewer and fewer 
observations toward the extreme ends of the range.  Such a curve is called a normal distribution .   
Central tendency  is an estimate of the center of a distribution of values.  There are 
three major estimates of central tendency: mean, median, and mode.  The arithmetic mean  
(often simply called the “mean”) is the simple average of all values in a given distribution.  
Con sider a set of eight test scores: 15, 22, 21, 18, 36, 15, 25, 15.  The arithmetic mean of these 
values is (15 + 20 + 21 + 20 + 36 + 15 + 25 + 15)/8 = 20.875.  Other types of means include 
geometric mean  (nth root of the product of n numbers in a distributi on) and harmonic mean  (the 
reciprocal of the arithmetic means of the reciprocal of each value in a distribution), but these 
means are not very popular for statistical analysis of social research data.  

122 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 The second measure of central tendency, the median , is the middle value with in a range 
of values in a distribution.  This is computed by sorting all values in a distribution in increasing 
order and selecting the middle value.  In case there are two middle values (if there is an even 
number of values in a distr ibution), the average of the two middle values represent the median.  
In the above example, the sorted values  are: 15, 15, 15, 18, 22, 21, 25, 36.  The two middle 
values are 18 and 22, and hence the median is (18 + 22)/2 = 20.   
Lastly, the mode  is the mos t frequently occurring value in a distribution of values.  In 
the previous example, the most frequently occurring value is 15, which is the mode of the above 
set of test scores.  Note that any value that is estimated from a sample, such as mean, median, 
mode, or any of the later estimates are called a statistic . 
Dispersion  refers to the way values are spread  around the central tendency, for 
example, how tightly or how widely are the values  clustered around the mean.  Two common 
measures of dispersion are the range and standard deviation.  The range  is the difference 
between the highest and lowest values in a distribution.  The range in our previous example is 
36-15 = 21.   
The range is part icularly sensitive to the presence of outliers.  For instance, if the 
highest value in the above distribution was 85 and the other vales remained the same, the range 
would be 85 -15 = 70.  Standard deviation , the second measure of dispersion, corrects for s uch 
outliers by using a formula  that takes into account how close or how far each value from the 
distribution mean : 
 
where σ is the standard deviation, x i is the ith observation (or value), µ is the arithmetic mean, n 
is the total number of observations, and Σ means summation across all observations.  The 
square of the standard deviation is called the variance  of a distribution.  In a normally 
distributed frequency distribution, it is seen that 68% of the observations lie within one 
standard deviation of t he mean (µ + 1 σ), 95% of the observations lie within two standard 
deviations (µ + 2 σ), and 99.7% of the observations lie within three standard deviations  (µ + 3 
σ), as shown in Figure 14.2 . 
Bivariate Analysis  
 Bivariate analysis examines how two variables are related to each other.  The most 
common bivariate statistic is the bivariate correlation  (often, simply called “correlation”), 
which is a number between -1 and +1 denoting the strength of the relationship b etween two 
variables.  Let’s say that we wish to study how age is related to self-esteem in a sample of 20 
respondents, i.e., as age increases, does self -esteem increase, decrease, or remains unchanged.  
If self -esteem increases, then we have a positive co rrelation between the two variables, if self -
esteem decreases, we have a negative correlation, and if  it remains the same, we have a  zero 
correlation.  To calculate the value of this correlation, consider the hypoth etical dataset shown 
in Table 14 .1.

Figure 14.2.  Normal distribution  
 
Table 14 .1. Hypothetical data on age and self -esteem  
The two variables in this dataset are age (x) and self -esteem (y).  Age is a ratio -scale 
variable, while self -esteem is an average score computed from a multi -item self -esteem scale 
measured using a 7 -point Likert scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to  “strongly agree.”  The 
histogram of each variable is sho wn on the left side of Figure 14.3 .  The formula for calculating 
bivariate correlation is:  
 
where r xy is the correlation, x  and y are the sample  means  of x and y, and  sx and sy are 
the  standard deviations  of x and y.  The manually computed value of correlation between age 
and self -esteem, using the abo ve formula as shown in Table 14 .1, is 0.79.  This figure indicates 

124 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 that age has a strong positive correlation with self-esteem, i.e., self-esteem tends to increase 
with increasing age, and decrease with decreasing age.  Such pattern can also be seen from 
visually comparing the age and self -esteem histograms shown in Figure 14 .3, where it appears 
that the top of the two histograms generally follow each other.  Note here that  the vertical axes 
in Figure 14 .3 represent actual observation values, and not the frequency of observations  (as 
was in Figure 14 .1), and hence, these are not frequency dist ributions  but rather histograms .  
The biv ariate scatter plot in the right panel of Figure 14 .3 is essentially a plot of self -esteem on 
the vertical axis against age on the horizontal axis.  This plot roughly resembles a n upward 
sloping  line (i.e., positive slope ), which is also indicative of a positive correlation.  If the two 
variables were negative ly correlated , the scatter plot would slope down (negative slope) , 
implying that an increase in age would be related to a decrease in self -esteem and vice versa.  If 
the two variables were uncorrelated, the s catter plot would approximate a horizontal line  (zero 
slope) , implying than an increase in age would have no systematic bearing on self -esteem.  
 
Figure 14 .3.  Histogram and correlation plot of age and self -esteem  
 After computing bivariate correlation, re searchers are often interested in knowing 
whether the correlation is significant (i.e., a real one) or caused by mere chance.  Answering 
such a question would require testing the following hypothesis:  
H0: r = 0  
H1: r ≠ 0  
 H0 is called the null hypotheses , and H1 is called the alternative hypothesis  (sometimes, 
also represented as H a).  Although they may seem like two hypotheses, H 0 and H 1 actually 
represent a single hypothesis since they are direct opposites of each other.  We are interested in 
testing H1 rather than H0.  Also note that H 1 is a non -directional hypotheses since it does not 
specify whether r is greater than or less than zero.  Directional hypotheses will be specified as 
H0: r ≤ 0; H 1: r > 0 (if we are testing for a positive correlation).  Sign ificance testing of directional 
hypothesis is done using a one -tailed t -test, while that for non -directional hypothesis is  done 
using a two -tailed t -test. 

Q u a n t i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s :  D e s c r i p t i v e  S t a t i s t i c s  | 125 
 
 
 In statistical testing, the alternative hypothesis cannot be tested directly.  Rather, it is 
tested indirectly by rejecting the null hypotheses with a certain level of probability.  Statistical 
testing is always probabilistic, b ecause we are never sure if our inferences, based on sample 
data, apply  to the population , since  our sam ple never equals the popu lation.   The probability 
that a statistical inference is caused pure chance  is called the p-value .  The p -value is compared 
with the significance level  (α), which represents the maximum level of risk that we are willing 
to take that our inference is incorrect .  For most statistical analysis, α is set to 0.05.   A p-value 
less than α=0.05  indicates that we have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, 
and thereby, indirectly accept the alternative hypothesis.  If p> 0.05 , the n we do no t have 
adequate statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternative hypothesis.  
The easiest way to test for the above hypothesis is to look up critical values of r from 
statistical tables available in any standard text book  on statistics or on the Internet (most 
software programs also perform significance testing).  The critical value of r depends on our 
desired significance level (α = 0.05), the degrees of freedom (df), and whether the desired test is 
a one -tailed or two -tailed te st.  The degree of freedom  is the number of values that can vary 
freely in any calculation of a statistic.  In case of correlation, the df simply equals n – 2, or for the 
data in Table 14.1 , df is 20 – 2 = 18.  There are two different statistical tables for one -tailed and 
two-tailed test.  In the two -tailed table, the critical value of r for α = 0.05 and df = 18 is 0.44.  For 
our computed correlation of 0.79 to be significant, it must be larger than  the critical value of 
0.44 or less than -0.44.  Since our computed value of 0.79 is greater than 0.44 , we conclude that 
there is a significant correlation between age and  self-esteem in our data set, or in other words,  
the odds are less than 5% that this  correlation is a chance occurrence.  Therefore, we can reject 
the null hypotheses  that r ≤ 0,  which is an indirect way of saying that the alternative hypothesis  
r > 0  is probably correct.  
Most research studies involve more than two variables.  If there are n variables, then we 
will have a total of n* (n-1)/2 possible correlations  between these n variables.  Such correlations 
are easily computed using a software program like SPSS, rather than  manually using the 
formula  for correlation (as we did in Table 14.1) , and represented using a correlation matrix , as 
shown in Table 14. 2.  A correlation matrix is a matrix that lists the variable names along the 
first row and the first column, and depicts  bivariate correlations between pairs of variables in 
the appropriate cell in the matrix.  The values along the principal diagonal (from the top left to 
the bottom right corner) of this matrix are always 1, because any variable is always perfectly 
correlat ed with itself.  Further, since correlations are non -directional, the correlation between 
variables V1 and V2 is the same as that between V2 and V1.  Hence, the lower triangular matrix 
(values below the principal diagonal) is a mirror reflection of the upp er triangular matrix 
(values above the principal diagonal), and therefore, we often list only the lower triangular 
matrix for s implicity .  If the correlation s involve variables measured using interval scales , then 
this specific type  of correlations  are cal led Pearson product moment correlations .   
Another useful way of presenting bivariate data is cross -tabulation (often abbreviated 
to cross -tab, and sometimes called more formally as a contingency table).  A cross -tab is a table 
that describes the frequency (or percentage) of all combinations of two or more nominal or 
categorical variables.  As an example, let us assume that we have the following observations of 
gender and grade for a sample of 20 students , as shown in  Figure 14.3 .  Gender is a nominal 
variable (male/female or M/F), and grade is a categorical variable with three levels (A, B, and 
C).  A simple cross -tabulation of the data may display the joint distribution of gender and grades 
(i.e., how many students o f each gender are in each grade category, as a raw frequency count or 
as a  percentage) in a 2 x 3 matrix.  This matrix will help us see if A, B, and C grades are equally 
126 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 distributed across male and female students.  The cross -tab data in Table 14.3  shows t hat the 
distribution of A grades is biased heavily toward female students: in a sample of 10 male and 10 
female students, five female students received the A grade compared to only one male students.  
In contrast, the distribution of C grades is biased tow ard male students: three male students 
received a C grade, compared to only one female student .  However, the distribution of B grades 
was somewhat uniform, with six male students and five female students.  The last row and the 
last column of this table ar e called marginal totals because they indicate the totals across each 
category and displayed along the margins of the table.  
 
Table 14 .2.  A hypothetical correlation matrix for eight variables  
 
Table 14 .3.  Example of cross -tab analysis  
 Although we can see a distinct pattern of grade distribution between male  and female 
students in Table 14 .3, is this pattern real or “statistically significant”?  In other words, do the 
above frequency counts differ from that that may be expected from pure chance?  To ans wer 
this question, we should compute the expected count of observation in each cell of the 2 x 3 
cross -tab matrix.  This is done by multiplying the marginal column total and the marginal row 
total for each cell and dividing it by the total number of observ ations.  For example, for the 
male/A grade cell, expected count = 5 * 10 / 20 = 2.5.  In other words, we were expecting 2.5 
male students to receive an A grade, but in reality, only one student received the A grade.  
Whether this difference between expecte d and actual count is significant can be tested using a 
chi-square test .  The chi-square statistic can be comput ed as the average difference between 

Q u a n t i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s :  D e s c r i p t i v e  S t a t i s t i c s  | 127 
 
 
 observed and ex pected counts across all cells.  We can then compare this number to the critical 
value associated with a desired probability level (p < 0.05) and the degrees of freedom , which  
is simply (m-1)*(n -1), where m and n are the number of rows and columns  respectively.  I n this 
example , df = (2 – 1) * (3 – 1) = 2.  From standard chi-square tables i n any statistics book , the 
critical chi -square value for p=0.05 and df=2 is 5.99.  The computed chi -square value, based on 
our observed data, is 1.00, which is less than the critical value.  Hence, we must conclude that 
the observed grade pattern is not st atistically different from the pattern that can be expected by 
pure chance.

Quantitative Analysis:  
Inferential Statistics  
 
  
Inferential statistics are the statistical procedures that are used to reach conclusions 
about  associations between variables .  They differ from descriptive statistics in that they are 
explicitly designed to test hypotheses.  Numerous statistical procedures fall in this category, 
most of which are supported by modern statistical software such as SPSS and SAS.   This chapter 
provides a short primer on only the most basic and frequent  procedures; readers are advised to 
consult a formal text on statistics or take a course on statistics for more advanced procedures.  
Basic C oncepts  
British philosopher Karl Popper said that theories can never be proven, only disproven.  
As an example, how can we prove t hat the sun will rise tomorrow?  Popper said that just 
because the sun has risen every single day that we can remember does not necessarily mean 
that it will rise tomorrow, because inductively derived theories are only conjectures that may or 
may not be predictive of future phenomenon.  Instead, he suggested that we may assume a 
theory that the sun will rise every day with out necessarily proving it, and if the sun does not 
rise on a certain day, the theory is falsified and rejected .  Likewise , we can only reject 
hypotheses based on contrary evidence but can never truly accept them because presence of 
evidence does not mean that we may not observe contrary evidence later .  Because we cannot 
truly accept a hypothesis of interest (alternative hypothesis), we formulate a null hypothesis  as 
the opposite of the alternative hypothesis, and then use empirical evidence to reject the null 
hypothesis to demonstrate indirect, probabilistic support for our alternative hypothesis.  
A second problem with testing hypothesized relationships in social science research is 
that the dependent variable may be influenced by an infinite number of ext raneous variables 
and it is not plausible to measure and control for all of these extraneous effects.  Hence, even if 
two variables may seem to be related in an observed sample, they may not be truly related in 
the population, and therefore inferential sta tistics are never certain or deterministic, but always 
probabilistic.  
How do we know whether a relationship between two variables in an observed sample 
is significant, and not a matter of chance?  Sir Ronald A. Fisher, one of the most prominent 
statisticia ns in history, established the basic guidelines for significance testing.  He said that a 
statistical result may be considered significant if it can be shown that the probability of it being 
rejected due to chance is 5% or less.  In inferential statistics,  this probability is called the p-
130 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 value , 5% is called the significance level (α), and the desired relationship between the  p-value 
and α is denoted as: p≤ 0.05.  The significance level  is the maximum level of risk that we are 
willing to accept as the price of our inference from the sample to the population.  If the p -value 
is less than 0.05 or 5%, it means that we have a 5% chance of being incorrect in rejecting the 
null hypothesis or having a Type I error.  If p>0.05, we do not have enough evidence to rejec t 
the null hypothesis or accept the alternative hypothesis.   
We must also understand three related statistical concepts: sampling distribution, 
standard error, and confidence interval.  A sampling distribution  is the theoretical 
distribution of an infinite number of samples from the population of interest in your study.  
However, because a sample is never identical to the population, every sample always has some 
inherent level of error, called the standard erro r.  If this standard error is small, then statistical 
estimates derived from the sample (such as sample mean) are reasonably good estimates of the 
population.  The precision of our sample estimates is defined in terms of a confidence interval  
(CI).   A 95%  CI is defined as a range of plus or minus two standard deviations of the mean 
estimate, as derived from different samples in a sampling distribution.  Hence, when we say that 
our observed sample estimate has a CI of 95%, what we mean is that we are confid ent that 95% 
of the time, the population parameter is within two standard deviations of our observed sample 
estimate.  Jointly, the p -value and the CI give us a good idea of the probability of our result and 
how close it is from the corresponding populatio n parameter.  
General Linear Model  
Most inferential statistical procedures in social science research are derived from a 
general family of statistical models called the general linear model  (GLM).  A model  is an 
estimated mathematical equation that can be u sed to represent a set of data, and linear  refers to 
a straight line.  Hence, a GLM is a system of equations that can be used to represent linear 
patterns of relationships in observed data.   
 
Figure 15 .1.  Two -variable linear model  
The simplest type of GLM is a two -variable linear model that examines the relationship 
between one independent variable ( the cause or predictor) and one dependent variable ( the 
effect or outcome).  Let us assume that these two variables are age and self -esteem  respectively .  
The bivariate scatterplot for this re lationship is shown in Figure 15 .1, with age (predictor) 
along the horizontal or x -axis and self -esteem (outcome) along the vertical or y -axis.   From the 
scatterplot, it appears that individual observations representing combinations of age and self -
esteem generally seem  to be scattered around an imaginary upward sloping straight line.  We 

Q u a n t i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s :  I n f e r e n t i a l  S t a t i s t i c s  | 131 
 
 
 can estimate parameters of this line, such as its slope and intercept from the GLM.  From high -
school algebra, recall that straight lin es can be represented using the mathematical equation y = 
mx + c, where m is the slope  of the straight line (how much does y change for unit change in x) 
and c is the intercept  term (what is the value of y when x is zero).  In  GLM , this equation is 
represe nted formally as:  
y = β 0 + β 1 x + ε 
where β0 is the sl ope, β1 is the intercept term , and ε is the  error term .  ε represents the deviation 
of actual observations from their estimated value s, since most observations are close to the line 
but do  not fall exactly on the line (i.e., the GLM is not perfect) .  Note that a linear model can have 
more than two predictors.  To visualize a linear model with two predictors, imagine a three -
dimensional cube, with the outcome (y) along the vertical axis, and  the two predictors (say, x 1 
and x 2) along the two horizontal axes along the base of the cube.  A line that describes the 
relationship between two or more variables is called a regression line, β 0 and β 1 (and other beta 
values) are called regression coeffi cients , and the process of estimating regression coefficients is 
called regression  analysis .  The GLM for regression analysis with n predictor variables is:  
y = β 0 + β 1 x1 + β 2 x2 + β 3 x3 + … + β n xn + ε 
In the above equation, predictor variables x i may represent independent variables or 
covariates  (control variables).  Covariates are variables that are not of theoretical interest but 
may have some impa ct on the dependent variable y and should be control led, so that the 
residual effects of the independent  variables of interest are detected more precisely.  Covariates 
capture  systematic errors in a regression equation while the error term ( ε) captures random 
errors.  Though most variables in the GLM tend to be interval or ratio -scaled, this does not have 
to be the case.  Some predictor variables may even be nominal variables (e.g., gender: male or 
female), which are coded as dummy variables .  These are variables that can assume one of only 
two possible values: 0 or 1 (in the gender example, “male” may be des ignated as 0 a nd “female” 
as 1 or vice versa).  A set of n nominal variables is represen ted using n –1 dummy variables.    For 
instance, industry sector, consisting of the agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors, may 
be represented using a combinatio n of two dummy variables (x 1, x2), with ( 0, 0) for agriculture, 
(0, 1 ) for manufacturing, and (1, 1 ) for service.  It does not matter which level of a nominal 
variable is coded as 0 and which level as 1, because 0 and 1 values are treated as two distinct 
groups (such as treatment and control groups in an experimental design), rather than as 
numeric quantities, and the statistical parameters of each group are estimated separately.  
The GLM is a very powerful statistical tool because it is not one single stat istical method, 
but rather a family of methods that can be used to conduct sophisticated analysis with different 
types and quantities of predictor and outcome variables.  If we have a dummy predictor 
variable, and we are comparing the effects of the two le vels (0 and 1) of this dummy variable on 
the outcome variable, we are doing an analysis of variance  (ANOVA).  If we are doing ANOVA 
while controlling for the effects of one or more covariate, we have an analysis of covariance  
(ANCOVA).  We can also have mu ltiple outcome variables (e.g., y 1, y 1, … y n), which are 
represented using a “system of equations” consisting of a different equation for each outcome 
variable (each with its own unique set of regression coefficients).  If multiple outcome variables 
are mo deled as being predicted by the same set of predictor variables, the resulting analysis is 
called multivariate regression .  If we are doing ANOVA or ANCOVA analysis with multiple 
outcome variables, the resulting analysis is a multivariate ANOVA  (MANOVA) or  multivariate 
ANCOVA  (MANCOVA) respectively.  If we model the outcome in one regression equation as a 
132 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 predictor in another equation in an interrelated  system of regression equations, then we have a 
very sophisticated type of analysis called structural equa tion modeling .  The most important 
problem in GLM is model specification , i.e., how to specify a regression equation (or a system of  
equations) to best represent  the phenomenon of interest.  Model specification should be based 
on theoretical considerations  about the phenomenon being studied, rather than what fits the 
observed data best.  The role of data is in validating the model, and not in its specification.  
Two -Group Comparison  
One of the simplest inferential  analyses is comparing  the post -test outcomes  of 
treatment and control group subjects in a randomized post -test only control group design , such 
as whether students enrolled to a special program in mathematics perform better than those in 
a traditional math curriculum.  In this case, t he predictor variable is a dummy variable 
(1=treatment group, 0=control group), and the outcome variable, performance, is ratio scaled 
(e.g., score of a math test following the special program).  The analytic technique for this simple 
design is a one-way A NOVA  (one -way because it involves only one predictor variable), and the 
statistical test used is called a Student’s t -test (or t -test, in short).   
The t -test was introduced in 1908 by William Sealy Gosset, a chemi st working for the 
Guiness Brewe ry in Dubl in, Ireland to monitor the quality of stout – a dark beer popular with 
19th century porters in London.  Because his employer did not want to reveal the fact that it was 
using statistics for quality control, Gosset published the test in  Biometrika  using  his pen name  
“Student” ( he was a  student of Sir Ronald Fisher),  and the test involved cal culating the value of 
t, which wa s a letter used frequently by Fisher to denote the difference between two groups.  
Hence, the name Stude nt’s t -test, although Student ’s identity was known to fellow statisticians . 
The t -test examines whether the means of two groups are statistically different from 
each other  (non-direction al or two-tailed test ), or whether one group has a statistically larger 
(or smaller) mean than the other  (directional or one-tailed test ).  In our example, if we wish to 
examine whether students in the special math curriculum perform better than those in 
traditional curriculum, we have a one -tailed test.  This hypothesis can be stated as:  
H0: μ1 ≤ μ 2                       (null hypothesis)  
H1: μ1 > μ 2         (alternative hypothesis)  
where μ1 represents the mean population performance of students exposed to the special 
curriculum  (treatment group) and μ 2 is the mean population performance of students  with 
traditional curriculum (control group).  Note that the null hypothesis is always the one with the 
“equal” sign, and the goal of all statistical significance test s is to reject the null hypothesis.   
 How can we infer about the difference in population  means using data from samples 
drawn from each population?  From the hypothetical frequency distributions of the treatment 
and control group scores in Figure 1 5.2, the control group appears to have a bell -shaped 
(normal) distribution with a mean score of 45 (on a 0 -100 scale), while the treatment group 
appear to have a mean score of 65.  These means look different, but they are really sample 
means (), which may differ from  their corresponding population means ( μ) due to sampling 
error.  Sample means are probabilistic estimates of population means within a certain 
confidence interval (95% CI is sample mean + two standard errors, where standard error is the 
standar d deviation of the distribution in sample means as taken from infinite samples of the 
population.  Hence, statistical significance of population means depends not only on sample 

Q u a n t i t a t i v e  A n a l y s i s :  I n f e r e n t i a l  S t a t i s t i c s  | 133 
 
 
 mean scores, but also on the standard error or the degree of spread in the fre quency 
distribution of the sample means.  If the spread is large (i.e., the two bell -shaped curves have a 
lot of overlap), then the 95% CI of the two means may also be overlapping, and we cannot 
conc lude with high probability (p< 0.05) that that their corre sponding population means are 
significantly different.  However , if the curves have narrower spreads (i.e., they are less 
overlapping), then the CI of each mean may not overlap, and we reject the null hypothesis and 
say that the population means of the two  groups a re significantly different at p< 0.05.   
 
Figure 1 5.2. Student’s t -test 
To conduct the t -test, we must first compute a t -statistic  of the difference is sample 
means  between the two groups.  This statistic is the ratio of the difference in sample means 
relative to the difference in their variabi lity of scores (standard error) :  
 
where the numerator is the difference in sample means between the treatment group (Group 1) 
and the control group (Group 2) and the denominator is the standard error of the difference 
between the two groups, which in turn, can be estimated as:  
 
s2 is the variance and n is the s ample size of each group .  The t -statistic will be positive if the 
treatment mean is greater than the control mean.  To examine if this  t-statistic is large enough 
than that possible by chance , we must look up the probability or p -value associated with our  
computed t -statistic  in statistical tables available in standard statistic s text book s or on the 
Internet or as computed by statistical software programs such as SAS and SPSS.  This value is a 
function of the t-statistic , whether the t-test is one -tailed or two -tailed , and the degrees of 
freedom  (df) or the number of values that can vary freely in the calculation of the statistic 
(usually a function of the sample size and the type of test being performed).  The degree of 
freedom of the t -statistic is compu ted as:  
 

134 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 which  often approximates to (n1+n2–2).  If this p -value is smaller than a desired significance 
level  (say α= 0.05) or the highest level of risk (probability) we are willing to take to conclude 
that there is a treatment effect when in fact there is none (Type I error), then we can reject the 
null hypotheses.   
 After demonstrating whether  the treatment group has a  significantly higher mean than 
the control group, the next question usually is what is the effect size  (ES) or the magnitude of 
the treatment effect relative to the control group?  We can estimate the ES by conducting 
regression analysis with performance scores as the outcome variable (y) and a dummy coded 
treatment variable as the predictor variable ( x) in a two-variable GLM.  The regression 
coefficient of the treatment variable (β 1), which is also the slope of the regression line ( β1 = 
Δy/Δx), is an estimate of the effect size .  In the above example, s ince x is a dummy variable  with 
two values (0 and 1), Δx = 1 –0 = 1, and hence the effect size or β 1 is simply the difference 
between treatment and control means ( Δy = y 1- y2).   
Factorial Designs  
 Extending from the previous example, let us say that the effect of the special curriculum 
(treatment) relative to traditional curriculum (control) depends on the amount of instructional 
time (3 or 6 hours/week).  Now, we have a 2 x 2 factorial design, with  the two factors being 
curriculum type ( special versus  traditional ) and instructional type (3 or 6 hours/week).  Such a 
design not only help s us estimate the independent effect of each factor, called main effects , but 
also the joint effect of both factors,  called the interaction effect .  The generalized linear model 
for this two-way factorial design is designated as follows:  
y = β 0 + β 1 x1 + β 2 x2 + β 3 x1 x2 + ε 
where y represents students’  post -treatment performance score s, x1 is the treatment ( special  
versus  traditional  curriculum), x2 is instructional time (3 or 6 hours/week).  Note that both x1 
and x2 are dummy variables, and although x2 looks like a ratio -scale variable (3 or 6), it actually 
represents two categories in the factorial design.  Regres sion coefficients β1 and β2 provide 
effect size estimates for the main effects and β3 for the interaction effect.  Alternatively, the 
same factorial model can be analyzed using a two -way ANOVA analysis.  Regression analysis 
involving multiple predictor variables is sometimes called multiple regression, which is 
different from multivariate regress ion that uses  multiple outcome variables.  
 A note on interpreting interaction effects.  If β3 is significant, it implies that the effect of 
the treatment (curric ulum type) on student performance depends on instructional time.  In this 
case , we cannot meaningfully interpret  the independent effect of the treatment ( β1) or of 
instructional time ( β2), because the two effects cannot be isolated from each other .  Main e ffects 
are interpretable only when the interaction effect is non -significant.   
 Covariates can be included in factorial designs as new variable s, with new regression 
coefficient s (e.g.,  β4).  Covariates can be measured using interval or ratio scaled measu res, even 
when the predictors of interest  are designated as dummy variables.  Interpretation of 
covariates also follow s the same rules as that of any other predictor variable.

 Other Quantitative Analysis  
There are many other useful inferential statistical techniques, based on variatio ns in the 
GLM,  that are briefly mentioned here.  Interested readers are referred to advanced text book s or 
statistics courses for more information on these techniques:  
 Factor analysis  is a data reduction technique t hat is used to statistically aggregate a 
large number of observed measures (items)  into a smaller set of unobserved (latent) 
variables called factors  based on their underlying bivariate correlation patterns .  This 
technique is widely used for assessment of  convergent and discriminant validity in 
multi -item measurement scales in social science research .   
 Discriminant analysis  is a classificatory technique that aims to place a given observation 
in one of several nominal categories based on a linear combinati on of predictor 
variables.  The technique is similar to multiple regression, except that the dependent 
variable is nominal.  It is popular in marketing applications, such as for classifying 
customers or products in to categories based on salient attributes as identified from 
large -scale surveys.  
 Logistic regression  (or logit model ) is a GLM in which the outcome variable is binary (0 
or 1) and is presumed to follow a logistic distribution, and the goal of the regression 
analysis is to predict the probability of the successful outcome by fitting data into a 
logistic curve.  An example is predicting the probability of heart attack within a specific 
period, based on predictors such as age, body mass index, exercise regimen, and so 
forth.  Logistic regression is e xtremely popular in the medical sciences.  Effect size 
estimation is based on an “ odds ratio ,” representing the odds of an event occurring in 
one group versus the other.  
 Probit regression  (or probit model ) is a GLM in which the outcome variable can vary 
between 0 and 1 (or can assume discrete values 0 and 1) and is presumed to follow a 
standard normal distribution, and the goal of the regression is to predict the probability 
of each outcome.  This is a popular technique for predictive analysis in the actu arial 
science, financial services, insurance, and other industries for applications such as credit 
scoring based on a person’s credit  rating , salary, debt and other information from her 
loan application .  Probit and logit  regression tend to demonstrate sim ilar regression 
coefficients in comparable applications (bin ary outcomes); however the logit  model is 
easier to compute and interpret.  
 Path analysis  is a multivariate GLM technique for analyzing directional relationships 
among a set of variables.  It allow s for examination of complex nomological models 
where the dependent variable in one equation is the independent variable in another 
equation , and is widely  used in contemporary social science research.    
 Time series analysis  is a technique for analyzing t ime series da ta, or variables that 
continually  changes with time.  Examples of applications include forecasting stock 
market fluctuations and urban crime rates.  This technique is popular in econometrics, 
mathematical finance, and signal processing.  Speci al techniques are used to correct for 
auto -correlation, or correlation within values of the same variable across time.

Research Ethics  
 
  
Ethics is defined by Webster’s dictionary as conformance to the standards of conduct of 
a given profession or group.  Such standards are often defined at a disciplinary level though a 
professional code of conduct, and sometimes enforced by university commi ttees called even 
Institutional Review Board.  Even if not explicitly specified, scientists are still expected to be 
aware of and abide by general agreements shared by the scientific community on what 
constitutes acceptab le and non -acceptable behaviors  in the professional conduct of science.   
For instance, scientists should not manipulate their data collection, analysis, and interpretation 
procedures in a way that contradicts the principles of science or the scientific method or 
advances their personal age nda.   
Why is research ethics important?  Because, science has often been manipulated in 
unethical ways by people and organizations to advance their private agenda and engaging in 
activities that are contrary to the norms of scientific conduct.  A classic example is 
pharmaceutical giant Merck’s drug trials of Vioxx, where the company hid the fatal side -effects 
of the drug from the scientific community, resulting  in 3468 deaths  of Vioxx recipients , mostly 
from cardiac arrest .  In 2010, the company agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement and appointed 
two independent committees and a chief medical officer to monitor the safety of its drug 
development process.  Merck’s conduct was unethical and violation the scientific principles of 
data collection, analysis, and interpretation.  
Ethics is the moral distinction between right and wrong, and what is unethical may not 
necessarily be illegal.  If a scientist’s conduct falls within the gray zone between ethics and law, 
she may not be culpable in the eyes of the law, but may still be ostracized in her professional 
community, face severe damage to professional reputation, and may even lose her job on 
grounds of professional misconduct.  These ethical norms may vary from one society to another, 
and here, we refer to ethical standards as applied to scientific research in Western countries.   
Ethical Principles in Scientific Research  
Some of the expected tenets of ethical behavior that are widely accepted within the 
scientific community are as follows.  
Voluntary participation and harmlessness.   Subjects in a research project must be 
aware that their participation in the study is voluntary, that they have the freedom to with draw 
from the study at any time without any unfavorable consequences, and they are not harmed as 
a result of their participation or non -participation in the project.  The most flagrant violations of 
138 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 the voluntary participation principle are probably forced  medical experiments conducted by 
Nazi researchers on prisoners of war during World War II, as documented in the post -War 
Nuremberg Trials (these experiments also originated the term “crimes against humanity”).  
Less known violations include the Tuskegee s yphilis experiments conducted by the U.S. Public 
Health Service during 1932 -1972, in which nearly 400 impoverished African -American men 
suffering from syphilis were denied treatment even after penicillin was accepted as an effective 
treatment of syphilis, and subjects were presented with false treatments such as spinal taps as 
cures for syphilis.  Even if subjects face no mortal threat, they should not be subjected to 
personal agony as a result of their participation.  In 1971, psychologist Philip Zambardo created 
the Stanford Prison Experiment, where Stanford students recruited as subjects were randomly 
assigned to roles such as prisoners or guards.  When it became evident that student prisoners 
were suffering psychological damage as a result of their mock incarceration and student guards 
were exhibiting sadism that would later challenge their own self -image, the experiment was 
terminated.  
Today, if an instructor asks her students to fill out a questionnaire and informs them 
that their participation is volun tary, students must not fear that their non -participation may 
hurt their grade in class in any way.  For instance, it in unethical  to provide bonus points for 
participation and no bonus points for non -participations, because it places non -participants at a 
distinct disadvantage.  To avoid such circumstances, the instructor may possibly provide an 
alternate task for non -participants so that they can recoup the bonus points without 
participating in the research study, or by providing bonus points to everyone  irrespective of 
their participation or non -participation.  Furthermore, all participants must receive and sign an 
Informed Consent  form that clearly describes their right to not participate and right to 
withdraw, before their responses in the study can be  recorded.  In a medical study, this form 
must also specify any possible risks to subjects from their participation.  For subjects under the 
age of 18, this form must be signed by their parent or legal guardian.  Researchers must retain 
these informed cons ent forms for a period of time (often three years) after the completion of 
the data collection process in order comply with the norms of scientific conduct in their 
discipline or workplace.  
Anonymity and confidentiality.   To protect subjects’ interests and  future well -being, 
their identity must be protected in a scientific study.  This is done using the dual principles of 
anonymity and confidentiality.  Anonymity  implies that the researcher or readers of the final 
research report or paper cannot identify a given response with a specific respondent.  An 
example of anonymity in scientific research is a mail survey in which no identification numbers 
are used to track who is responding to the survey and who is not.  In studies of deviant or 
undesirable behaviors , such as drug use or illegal music downloading by students, truthful 
responses may not be obtained if subjects are not assured of anonymity.  Further, anonymity 
assures that subjects are insulated from law enforcement or other authorities who may have an 
interest in identifying and tracking such subjects in the future.  
In some research designs such as face -to-face interviews, anonymity is not possible.  In 
other designs, such as a longitudinal field survey, anonymity is not desirable because it prevents 
the researcher from matching responses from the same subject at different points in time for 
longitudinal analysis.  Under such circumstances, subjects should be guaranteed 
confidentiality , in which the researcher can identify a person’s responses, but promi ses not to 
divulge that person’s identify in any report, paper, or public forum.  Confidentiality is a weaker 
form of protection than anonymity, because social research data do not enjoy the “privileged 
communication” status in United State courts as do co mmunication with priests or lawyers.  For

 instance, two years after the Exxon Valdez supertanker spilled ten million barrels of crude oil 
near the port of Valdez in Alaska, the communities suffering economic and environmental 
damage commissioned a San Dieg o research firm to survey the affected households about 
personal and embarrassing details about increased psychological problems in their family.  
Because the cultural norms of many Native Americans made such public revelations 
particularly painful and dif ficult, respondents were assured confidentiality of their responses.  
When this evidence was presented to court, Exxon petitioned the court to subpoena the original 
survey questionnaires (with identifying information) in order to cross -examine respondents 
regarding their answers that they had given to interviewers under the protection of 
confidentiality, and was granted that request.  Luckily, the Exxon Valdez case was settled before 
the victims were forced to testify in open court, but the potential for si milar violations of 
confidentiality still remains.   
In one extreme case, Rick Scarce, a graduate student at Washington State University, 
conducted participant observation st udies of animal rights activi sts, and chronicled his findings 
in a 1990 book calle d Ecowarriors: Understanding the Radical Environmental Movement .  In 
1993, Scarce was called before a grand jury to identify the activists he studied.  The researcher 
refused to answer grand jury questions, in keeping with his ethical obligations as a memb er of 
the American Sociological Association, and was forced to spend 159 days at Spokane County 
Jail.  To protect themselves from travails similar to Rik Scarce, researchers should remove any 
identifying information from documents and data files as soon as  they are no longer necessary.  
In 2002, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued a “Certificate of 
Confidentiality” to protect participants in research project from police and other authorities.  
Not all research projects qualify f or this protection, but this can provide an important support 
for protecting participant confidentiality in many cases.  
Disclosure.   Usually, researchers have an obligation to provide some information about 
their study to potential subjects before data col lection to help them decide whether or not they 
wish to participate in the study.  For instance, who is conducting the study, for what purpose, 
what outcomes are expected, and who will benefit from the results.  However, in some cases, 
disclosing such info rmation may potentially bias subjects’ responses.  For instance, if the 
purpose of a study is to examine to what extent subjects will abandon their own views to 
conform with “groupthink” and they participate in an experiment where they listen to others’ 
opinions on a topic before voicing their own, then disclosing the study’s purpose before the 
experiment will likely sensitize subjects to the treatment.  Under such circumstances, even if the 
study’s purpose cannot be revealed before the study, it should be revealed in a debriefing 
session immediately following the data collection process , with a list of potential riska or harm 
borne by the participant during the experiment.  
Analysis and reporting.   Researchers also have ethical obligations to the scientific 
community on how data is analyzed and reported in their study.  Unexpected or negative 
findings should be fully disclosed, even if they cast some doubt on the research design or the 
findings.  Similarly, many interesting relationships are discovered after a study is completed, by 
chance or data mining.  It is unethical to present such findings as the product of deliberate 
design.  In other words, hypotheses should not be designed in positivist research after the fact 
based on the results of data analysis, b ecause the role of data in such research is to test 
hypotheses, and not build them.  It is also unethical to “carve” their data into different segments 
to prove or disprove their hypotheses of interest, or to generate multiple papers claiming 
different dat a sets.  Misrepresenting questionable claims as valid based on partial, incomplete, 
or improper data analysis is also dishonest.  Science progresses through openness and honesty, 
140 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 and researchers can best serve science and the scientific community by fully disclosing the 
problems with their research, so that they can save other researchers from similar problems.   
Institutional Review Boards  
Research ethics in studies involving human subjects is governed in the United States by 
federal law.  Any agency, such  as a university or a hospital, that wants to apply for federal 
funding to support its research projects must establish that it is in compliance with federal laws 
governing the rights and protection of human subjects.  This process is overseen by a panel o f 
experts in that agency called an Institutional Review Board  (IRB).  The IRB reviews all 
research proposal involving human subjects to ensure that the principles of voluntary 
participation, harmlessness, anonymity, confidentiality, and so forth are preser ved, and that the 
risks posed to human subjects are minimal.  Even though the federal laws apply specifically for 
federally funded projects, the same standards and procedures are also applied to non -funded or 
even student projects.   
The IRB approval proce ss require completing a structured application providing 
complete information about the research project, the researchers (principal investigators), and 
details on how the subjects’ rights will be protected.  Additional documentation such as the 
Informed C onsent form, research questionnaire or interview protocol may be needed.  The 
researchers must also demonstrate that they are familiar with the principles of ethical research 
by providing certification of their participation in an research ethics course.  Data collection can 
commence only after the project is cleared by the IRB review committee.  
Professional Code of Ethics  
Most professional associations of researchers have established and published formal 
codes of conduct describing what constitute acceptab le and unacceptable professional behavior 
of their member researchers.  As an example, the summarized code of conduct for the 
Association of Information Systems (AIS), the global professional association of researchers in 
the information systems discipline , is summarized in Table 16 .1 (the complete code of conduct 
is available online at http://home.aisnet.org/ displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=15 ).  
Similar codes of ethics are also available for other disciplines.  
The AIS code of conduct groups ethical violations in two categories.  Category I includes 
serious transgressions such as plagiarism and falsification of data, research procedures, or data 
analysis, which may lead t o expulsion from the association, dismissal from employment, legal 
action, and fatal damage to professional reputation.  Category 2 includes less serious 
transgression such as not respecting the rights of research subjects, misrepresenting the 
originality of research projects, and using data published by others without acknowledgement, 
which may lead to damage to professional reputation, sanctions from journals, and so forth.  
The code also provides guidance on good research behaviors, what to do when ethic al 
transgressions are detected (for both the transgressor and the victim), and the process to be 
followed by AIS in dealing with ethical violation cases.  Though codes of ethics such as this have 
not completely eliminated unethical behavior, they have cert ainly helped clarify the boundaries 
of ethical behavior in the scientific community and reduced instances of ethical transgressions.  
 
 
R e s e a r c h  E t h i c s  | 141 
 
 
 CATEGORY ONE:   Codes in this category must ALWAYS be adhered to and disregard for them constitutes 
a serious ethical brea ch.  Serious breaches can result in your expulsion from academic associations, 
dismissal from your employment, legal action against you, and potentially fatal damage to your academic 
reputation . 
1. Do not plagiarize.  
2. Do not fabricate or falsify data, research  procedures, or data analysis.  
CATEGORY TWO: Codes in this category are recommended ethical behavior. Flagrant disregard of these 
or other kinds of professional etiquette, while less serious, can result in damage to your reputation, 
editorial sanctions, professional embarrassment, legal action, and the ill will of your colleagues.  
3. Respect the rights of re search subjects, particularly their rights to information privacy, and to 
being informed about the nature of the research and the types of activities in which they will be 
asked to engage.  
4. Do not make misrepresentations to editors and conference program chairs about the originality 
of papers you submit to them.  
5. Do not abuse the authority and responsibility you have been given as an editor, reviewer or 
supervisor, and ensure that personal relationships do not interfere with your judgement.  
6. Declare any mate rial conflict of interest that might interfere with your ability to be objective and 
impartial when reviewing submissions, grant applications, software, or undertaking work from 
outside sources.  
7. Do not take or use published data of others without acknowled gement, or unpublished data 
without both permission and acknowledgement.  
8. Acknowledge the substantive contributions of all research participants, whether colleagues or 
students, according to their intellectual contribution.  
9. Do not use other people’s unpubli shed writings, information, ideas, concepts or data that you 
may see as a result of processes such as peer review without permission of the author.  
10. Use archival material only in accordance with the rules of the archival source.  
ADVICE:  Some suggestions on  how to protect yourself from authorship disputes, mis -steps, mistakes, and 
even legal action.  
1. Keep the documentation and data necessary to validate your original authorship for each 
scholarly work with which you are connected.  
2. Do not republish old ideas o f your own as if they were a new intellectual contribution.  
3. Settle data set ownership issues before data compilation.  
4. Consult appropriate colleagues if in doubt.

An Ethical Controversy  
Robert Allen “Laud” Humphreys is an American sociologist and author, who is best 
known for his Ph.D.  dissertation,  Tearoom Trade , published in 1970.  This book is 
an ethnographic  account  of anonymous male homosexual encounters in  public toilets  in parks – 
a practice known as "tea -rooming" in U.S. gay slang .  Humphreys was intrigued by the fact that 
the majority of participants in tearoom activities  were outwa rdly heterosexual men, who lived  
otherwise conventional family lives in th eir communities.  However, it was important to them 
to preserve their anonymity during tearoom visits.   
142 | S o c i a l  S c i e n c e  R e s e a r c h   
 
 
 Typically, tearoom encounters involved three people – the two males engaging in a 
sexual act and a lookout person called a “watchqueen. ”  The job of th e watchqueen was to alert 
the two participating males for police or other people, while deriving pleasure from watch ing 
the action as a voyeur.  Because it was not otherwise possible to reach these subjects, 
Humphreys showed up at public toilets, masquerading as a watchqueen.  As a participant 
observer, Humphreys was able to conduct field observations for his dissertation,  as he normally 
would in a study of political protests or any other sociological phenomenon.   
Humphreys needed more information on the participants.  But because participants 
were unwilling to be interviewed in the field  or disclose personal identities , Humphreys wrote 
down the license plate numbers of the participants’ cars, wherever possible, and tracked down 
their names and addresses from public databases.  Then he visited these men at their homes, 
disguising himself to avoid recognition and announcing that he was conducting a survey, and 
collected personal data that was not otherwise available.   
Humphreys’ research generated considerable controversy within the scientific 
community.  Many critics said that he should not have invaded others’ right to pri vacy in the 
name of science, others were worried about his deceitful behavior in leading participants to 
believe that he was only a watchqueen, when he clearly had ulterior motives.  Even those who 
considered observing tearoom activity to be acceptable because the participants used public 
facilities, thought that the follow -up interview survey in participants’ homes under false 
pretenses was unethical, because of the way he obtained their home addresses and because he 
did not seek informed consent.  A few r esearchers justified Humphrey’s approach saying that 
this was an important sociologic al phenomenon worth investigati ng, that there was no other 
way to collect  this data, and that the deceit was harmless, since Humphreys did not disclose his 
subjects’ ident ities to anyone .  This controversy was never resolved, and it is still hotly debated 
in classes and forums on  research ethics.

Sample Syllabus for a Doctoral Course  
 
 
QMB 7565: Introduction to Research Methods  
University of South Florida  
College of Business  
Fall Semester 2011  
 
Objectives:  
The purpose of this course is to introduce doctoral students to the process of conducting 
academic research.  We will learn about how to think and act like a researcher in 
conceptualizing, designing, executing, and evaluating “scientific” research projects .  Part of the 
class will require you to design and write an independent research proposal (with your 
professor’s help).  In addition, the finals exam will prepare you for the research methods section 
of your Ph.D. comprehensives exam.   
Structure:  
This cl ass is designed in a seminar format.  This heart of any Ph.D. seminar is discussion 
and analysis of assigned readings.  To do that, you must read all assigned readings before class, 
think about these issues throughout the semester, debate these issues with  your classmates, 
and synthesize these issues mentally to develop yourself as a researcher.  Please note that if you 
do not come to class fully prepared, you will be totally lost and will not learn anything from the 
class.   
Being a doctoral seminar, this course will entail: (1) a much higher workload than any 
Masters -level course you have encountered thus far, (2) a heavy dose of boring readings, and 
(3) a substantial amount of critical and often frustrating thinking.  This is not an easy class and 
you wil l not receive an easy grade.  If you are challenged by the demanding nature of this class, 
you should drop this class and drop out of the Ph.D. program.

Finals Exam:  
This is a 3 -hour, comprehensive exam, in which you will be asked 3 -4 multi -part essay -type 
questions, similar to the ones in your Ph.D. comprehensive exams.  Sample exam questions can 
be downloaded from Blackboard.  You can either hand -write your answers on type them a 
computer.  Your answers should demonstrate (a) synthesis  of materials covered in class and (b) 
your own  critical analysis  of these materials, and not a mere regurgitation of the papers or the 
professor’s comments.  You will be graded solely on quality of your answer and not on how 
many pages you write.  You will lose credit if your answer is irrelevant (of the rambling type), 
does not contain enough details (too general or vague), or demonstrate just a superficial level of 
understanding of the materials discussed in class.  Exam is open -book/open -notes, but please 
be forewarned that having all the materials in front of you will not help, if you didn’t bother to 
prepare for the exams ahead of time.  Given the avalanche of topics and materials covered in 
class, cramming the week before the exams will be too little and too late.  
Research Proposal:  
You will apply  your learning about the research process into a research proposal that is due at 
the end of the semester.  This proposal will be 10 -12 pages single -spaced, excluding references 
and appendices.  You can select any research problem of your choice for this p roposal, but 
preferably in the positivist tradition of inquiry.  However, the proposed research must be 
original  (i.e., not something you are doing for another class or another professor), must 
examine a real problem (i.e., not a hypothetical or “toy” prob lem), and must be of at least a 
conference -level  quality.  Your proposal must include five sections: (1) research problem and 
significance, (2) literature review, (3) theory and hypotheses, (4) research methods, and (5) 
research plan.  Data collection or a nalysis is not necessary.  But if you want to do an interpretive 
research project instead, then some data collection and analysis will be needed (and the above 
structure will also change – talk to me about these changes).  Project deliverables are due 
thro ughout the course of the semester, as we cover corresponding topics in class.  This will 
allow me to give you early feedback and correct problems well before the final due date.  Note 
that intermediate deliverables are not graded, only your final proposal will be graded.  You will 
also present your final proposal during the last week of class in a 15 -20 minute formal 
S a m p l e  S y l l a b u s  | 145 
 
 
 presentation (plus a 5 minute question/answer session), as you would typically do at an 
academic conference.  
Paper Review:  
A key component of an academic career is critically evaluating others’ research.  During the 
second half of the semester, you’ll be asked to write a formal review (critique) of a paper 
submitted for publication to a leading business journal.  To help you prepare, I’ll discus s in class 
how to write reviews, give you a framework for review, and have you do one practice round of 
review in class for an actual journal submission.  After you write your review, I will give you 
actual reviews by anonymous reviewers/editors for this p aper so that you can compare your 
own review with that of professional reviewers, and see what you missed.  The graded paper 
review is take -home, and due one week before the finals.  You may need to do some background 
research or read some additional paper s before writing your review report, but you must not 
collaborate or discuss the paper with anyone in or out of class.  
Class Participation:  
Each paper discussed in class will be assigned a “lead discussant,” who will be responsible for 
(1) preparing a one -page synopsis of those papers (in a structured format) and (2) leading class 
discussion on that paper.  You will receive full class particip ation grade if you turn in synopsis 
of all assigned papers on time and do a reasonable job in class discussion.  Please see the sample 
synopsis to get an idea of how to structure these synopses.  These synopses can be useful study 
aids for the exams, but o nly if you do a thorough job with them.  Bring enough copies of the 
synopses to share with the rest of the class.  I’ll give you immediate feedback on your synopsis 
as we discuss the paper in class, so that you can try to improve your synopsis next time.  If you 
have to miss a class or would like to do a different paper, you can exchange your assigned paper 
with a classmate.  However, if there is a miscommunication and no synopsis is available for a 
paper on the discussion date, the student originally assig ned that paper will be penalized in 
his/her class participation grade.  Irrespective of synopsis assignment, everyone is expected to 
attend all classes, read all papers, and contribute to all class discussions.  
Class Policies:  
Attendance:   I do not take fo rmal attendance, but I do keep track of who is coming to class and 
who is not.  If you think you will miss more than one week of class during the semester , you 
should drop this class.   
Academic honesty:   Plagiarism in any form is banned and will result in  a straight FF grade.  
Please refer to USF’s academic honesty policy in your student handbook.   
Disability:   Students requiring disability accommodations should notify me within the first two 
weeks of class, with a letter from the Student Disability Servi ces Office.  
Cell phones:   Cell phones must be turned OFF  during the duration of the class, but you can use 
them during the breaks.

## 2. Kluczowe cytaty

(Do selekcji manualnej z pełnego tekstu powyżej – fragmenty dotyczące metodologii badań społecznych, projektowania badań, operacjonalizacji zmiennych.)

## 3. Wnioski dla projektu

- Projektowanie badań społecznych wymaga jasnej definicji problemu, hipotez i operacjonalizacji pojęć.  
- Ważne jest zapewnienie rzetelności (reliability) i trafności (validity) narzędzi badawczych.  
- W ankiecie należy uwzględniać pytania kontrolne i procedury minimalizujące bias (np. kolejność pytań, neutralne sformułowania).  
- Etap pilotażu jest kluczowy dla wykrycia problemów w zrozumieniu pytań i skal.  

## 4. Komentarz krytyczny

Dla naszego projektu oznacza to konieczność opracowania jasnego planu badania i iteracyjnego testowania ankiety, z wykorzystaniem pilotaży w różnych typach społeczności. Warto uwzględnić różnice kulturowe i językowe już na etapie definiowania zmiennych i konstruowania pytań.
